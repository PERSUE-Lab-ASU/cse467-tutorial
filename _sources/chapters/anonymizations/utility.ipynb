    "# Data utility\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is collected and released for its usefulness. Privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as k-anonymity, removes parts of the data, and thus may lower utility. But how much utility is retained in a privacy-enhanced version of a dataset? There are two methods to measure this: general data utility metrics or usefulness metrics of something else derived from the data (e.g., the accuracy of a machine learning model trained on the dataset in question). We will look at the first category in this chapter."

    "## Generalization or Suppression Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most intuitive measure of loss of utility is the number of privacy operations (generalization and suppression) has been performed, since each operation makes the data more generic and removes some utility. Consider the generalization steps on Race and Zip for the tuple $<Asian, 94141> \\rightarrow_{[1,1]} <person, 9414*>$. The number of operations here is 2, which can also be considered as proportional to the information that was lost. If only generalization is used, this loss is also equal to the height of the node in the tuple domain hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One proglem with this measure is that it treats information loss for all operations as equal. But generalizing Race once completely removes any information about race ($Asian\\rightarrow person$), but doing so for zip only removes some information (we can still guess the larger areas based on the remaining four digits). Even for the same attribute, (repeated) generalization operations can have different impact (compare 9414* to 941**)."
