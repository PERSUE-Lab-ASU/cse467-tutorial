    "How can we add enough noise to satisfy the DP property, but not too much that the answer becomes useless? Laplace mechanism is one of the most popular ways to achieve DP in such cases. Here, we add some noise, sampled from the Laplace distribution, to the actual query output, and return the noisy result. If the actual query function is denoted by $f$ that computes the query using dataset $D$, then the noisy return value becomes $f(D)+ L$, where $L$ is the Laplace noise. Since the noise is sampled from a distribution, each time we call the query function, a different amount of noise will be added. Thus, the whole mechanism becomes randomized, and, DP also requires a randomized algorithm. The final question is, how to appropriately set  the parameters of the Laplace function, so that when we add noise from it, we can satisfy the DP condition? \n",

    "The Laplace distribution for a zero mean is given by $L(b)=\\frac{1}{2b} e^{-\\frac{|x|}{b}}$ where $b$ is the variance parameter. To satisfy DP, we set $b= \\frac{\\Delta}{\\epsilon}$. So the noisy output becomes $f(D)+L(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\epsilon})$ . This whole randomized mechanism can be represented as $M(D, \\epsilon, \\Delta) = f(D)+L(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\epsilon})$, where $M$ is the randomized mechanism that takes a dataset, the privacy budget, and sensitivity of the query function, and produces a $\\epsilon$-differentially private outcome."
