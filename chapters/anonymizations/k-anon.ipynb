Records in a  dataset contain specific values from those domain, like 2139 in the voter datset. This domain of these specific values can be labeled as a ground domain, $D_0$. To achieve k-anonymity, we will replace these specific values with more generic values, coming from a more general domain. In the above example, we removed the last digit from the zip codes, and the set of these 1-less-digit zipcodes can be labeled as another domain, $D_1$. Continuing this generalization step one more time, we can use values from domain $D_2$ where two digits have been removed. Thus, these domains have a ordered mapping: $D_0\\rightarrow D_1\\rightarrow D_2\\rightarrow \\dots\\rightarrow D_n$ which must satisfy two conditions:  \n",

    "For example, consider domain generalization for marrital status. This attribute can have four values: $DGM_{M_0}=$ {married, divorced, single, widow}. A one step generalization of the domain gives us: $DGM_{M_1}$ = {once_married, never_married}. But how a specific value in a table row can be generalized? E.g., which general value from $DGM_{M_1}$ should replace `divorced`? It cannot be `never_married` and has to be `once_married`. These contstraints can be expressed in the value generalization hierarchy, $VGH_M$, which takes the form of a tree where a child node value can be replaced by it's parent's value. Thus, a value generalization hierarchy associates with each value in domain $D_i$ a unique value in domain $D_j$ direct generalization of $D_i$. Also note that in $DGM_M$, each domain has only one direct generalization ($DGM_{M_0}\\rightarrow DGM_{M_1}$). Also, the top level domain for $DGM_M$ has exactly one value.

    "Since we might generalize multiple attributes in a table (i.e., the quasi-identifier set contains multiple elements), it s convenient to think about generalization of domain tuple (DT) instead of single domain generalization. DT can be represented as a collection of domains: $<D_1, D_2, \\dots, D_n>$. For example, in the case of health dataset, if the quasi-identifiers include only `{Race, Zip}` with domains `R` and `Z`, respectively, the tuple containing the domains for these two attributes can be represented as $<R, Z>$. As with a single domain, we can define generalization hierarchy for a tuple of domains. Figure {ref}`dghT-fig` shows the domain tuple generalization hierarchy ($DGH_{DT}$) for Race and Zip, and an example (right) of generalization (dotted arrow indicates that intermediate steps were omitted). It defines the different ways in which the domain tuple $<R, Z>$ can be generalized: each path from DT to the unique maximal element of $DGH_{DT}$ in the graph describing $DGH_{DT}$ defines a possible alternative path that can be followed when generalizing a quasi-identifier `QI = {Race, Zip}` of attributes on domains `<R, Z>`.\n",

    "#### How to use domain generalization to achieve k-anonymity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we can replace specific values with generic ones, how should we apply this technique in a systematic way? In the above example of voter dataset, we removed the last digit of zip code (i.e., moved from $Z_0$ to $Z_1$ in $DGH_Z$) and achieved 2-anonymity. But we could also have removed two digits and achieve the same effect (i.e., move from $Z_0$ to $Z_2$ in $DGH_Z$). Replacing with more (rather than less) general data will never violate the k-anonymity condition for a given k. That is, if we achieve 2-anonymity by using $Z_1$ domain, we will definitely achieve 2-anonymity by using $Z_2$ domain. But, using more general data than necessary will reduce the utility of the data, otherwise we could have always used the most generic values to get maximal privacy, but the data will most likely be useless! To achieve k-anonymity for a specific k, we start with the most specific data (that exist in the table) and generalize one domain, one step at a time until we achieve k-anonymity. This concept is captured by the definition of k-minimal generalization. To introduce it we first introduce the notion of distance vector.\n",

    "The algorithm presented above to achieve k-anonymity does so by generalizing the full domain. That means, for an attribute (say Zip), all occurances of specific values (coming from domain $Z_0$) in the original table is replaced by values from another, more general domain (say $Z_2$). There are many other variants of k-anonymity. One of them is cell generalization, where each occurance of an attribute can be replaced by different general domain. Below is an example of such a table. Note that, in this generalized (4-anonymous) table, gender information has been completely removed for all rows, but some rows retained nationality. For zip, the specific values were replaced by values from different domain (some from $Z_1$, some from $Z_3$). Thus, this is not a full-domain generalization, rather individual cells were locally generalized using multiple domain. Usually such generalizations retain more utility.\n",
