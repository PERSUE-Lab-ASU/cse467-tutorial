The query is to return the \"best\" object from $R$ according to the scores of each objects. For example, if the scoring function returns the popularity of the employments, then the first query will return the employment type that the highest number of people (in the dataset) have. However, to protect privacy, instead of always returning the true most popular employment, sometimes, we might (randomly) return another job type that is not the most popular. The probability of returning an object (employment) is proportional to the score it receives from $u$, thus, the highest scored item (most popular job, in this case) also has the higest probability to be returned, but the exponential mechanism is probabilisticc and thus may also return object that is not the highest scored.
