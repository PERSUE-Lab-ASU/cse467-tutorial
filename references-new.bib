  abstract = {Until recently an assumption within the predictive modelling community has been that collecting more student data is always better. But in reaction to recent high profile data privacy scandals, many educators, scholars, students and administrators have been questioning the ethics of such a strategy. Suggestions are growing that the minimum amount of data should be collected to aid the function for which a prediction is being made. Yet, machine learning algorithms are primarily judged on metrics derived from prediction accuracy or whether they meet probabilistic criteria for significance. They are not routinely judged on whether they utilize the minimum number of the least sensitive features, preserving what we name here as data collection parsimony. We believe the ability to assess data collection parsimony would be a valuable addition to the suite of evaluations for any prediction strategy and to that end, the following paper provides an introduction to data collection parsimony, describes a novel method for quantifying the concept using empirical Bayes estimates and then tests the metric on real world data. Both theoretical and empirical benefits and limitations of this method are discussed. We conclude that for the purpose of model building this metric is superior to others in several ways, but there are some hurdles to effective implementation.},

The same issue could evoke concern or not in the span of an interview, sometimes even a single sentence. Drawing on dual-process theories from psychology, we argue that some of the apparent contradictions can be resolved if privacy concern is divided into two components we call intuitive concern, a "gut feeling," and considered concern, produced by a weighing of risks and benefits. Consistent with previous explanations of the so-called privacy paradox, we argue that people may express high considered concern when prompted, but in practice act on low intuitive concern without a considered assessment. We also suggest a new explanation: a considered assessment can override an intuitive assessment of high concern without eliminating it. Here, people may choose rationally to accept a privacy risk but still express intuitive concern when prompted.},

Our analysis focused on study methods; risk representation; the use of prototypes, scenarios, and educational intervention; the use of deception to simulate risk; and types of participants. We discuss benefits and shortcomings of the methods, and identify key methodological, ethical, and research challenges when representing and assessing security and privacy risk.

While prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. Our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. We conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. We identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). We highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. We discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes.},

  abstract = {Individuals share increasing amounts of personal multimedia data, exposing themselves (uploaders) as well as others (data subjects). Non-consensual sharing of multimedia data that depicts others raises so-called multiparty privacy conflicts (MPCs), which can have severe consequences. To limit the incidence of MPCs, a family of Precautionary mechanisms have recently been developed that force uploaders to collaborate with the other data subjects to prevent MPCs. However, there is still very little work on understanding how users perceive the precautionary mechanisms together with which ones they prefer and why. In addition, precautionary mechanisms have some limitations, e.g., they require linking content to the co-owners' identity. Therefore, we also explore alternatives to precautionary mechanisms and propose a new class of solutions-Dissuasive mechanisms-that aim at deterring the uploaders from sharing without consent. We then present a user-centric comparison of precautionary and dissuasive mechanisms, through a large-scale survey (N = 1792; a representative sample of adult Internet users). Our results showed that respondents prefer precautionary to dissuasive mechanisms. These enforce collaboration, provide more control to the data subjects, but also they reduce uploaders' uncertainty around what is considered appropriate for sharing. We learned that threatening legal consequences is the most desirable dissuasive mechanism, and that respondents prefer the mechanisms that threaten users with immediate consequences (compared with delayed consequences). Dissuasive mechanisms are in fact well received by frequent sharers and older users, while precautionary mechanisms are preferred by women and younger users. We discuss the implications for design, including considerations about side leakages, consent collection, and censorship.},

Most of the predictive analytic applications in higher education are proprietary, with private companies offering little transparency about their underlying models. We address this lack of transparency by systematically comparing two important dimensions: (1) different approaches to sample and variable construction and how these affect model accuracy and (2) how the selection of predictive modeling approaches, ranging from methods many institutional researchers would be familiar with to more complex machine learning methods, affects model performance and the stability of predicted scores. The relative ranking of students' predicted probability of completing college varies substantially across modeling approaches. While we observe substantial gains in performance from models trained on a sample structured to represent the typical enrollment spells of students and with a robust set of predictors, we observe similar performance between the simplest and the most complex models.}

This paper investigates distortions in consumer behavior when faced with notice and choice which may limit the ability of consumers to safeguard their privacy using field experiment data from the MIT digital currency experiment. There are three findings. First, the effect small incentives have on disclosure may explain the privacy paradox: Whereas people say they care about privacy, they are willing to relinquish private data quite easily when incentivized to do so. Second, small navigation costs have a tangible effect on how privacy-protective consumers' choices are, often in sharp contrast with individual stated preferences about privacy. Third, the introduction of irrelevant, but reassuring information about privacy protection makes consumers less likely to avoid surveillance, regardless of their stated preferences towards privacy.}

The combination of privacy risk measurement and reduction tools with a sound privacy risk management framework has the potential to manage privacy risk reliably and consistently across all datasets in a pragmatic and cost-effective way as tools evolve to integrate with standard data management infrastructure.},

From in-home digital assistants, to wearable health gadgets, to shopping and purchasing behavior online, questions about data collection and privacy abound. Examining students' descriptions of how they know about privacy risks and protections allows educators to imagine effective approaches for teaching about data privacy. Based on qualitative reports from students on a large public University campus (N = 267), this research interpretively considers means for reaching students with messages about privacy and related protections. Themes presented suggest students learn the most from direct experience with theft, fraud, or other privacy violations, but also show that instruction is effective via special events and classroom teachings. We conclude by exploring the role that teacher educators can play as they endorse, use, as well as teach with or about information technology.}

While single-point-in-time investigations of privacy sentiment offer useful insight, longitudinal study of people's privacy sentiments is necessary to better understand and anticipate evolving privacy attitudes. In this work, we use longitudinal survey data (n=6,676) to model Americans' sentiments toward collection and use of data for government- and health-related purposes in 2019, 2020 and 2021. After the onset of COVID-19, we observe significant changes in Americans' privacy sentiments toward government- and health-related data uses and find that Americans' privacy attitudes largely converged on these topics. We observe additional changes in the context of other national events such as the U.S. presidential elections and Black Lives Matter protests. Our results offer insight into how privacy attitudes may have been impacted by recent events, and these results allow us to identify potential predictors of changes in privacy attitudes during times of geopolitical (e.g., global pandemic) or national (e.g., political elections, the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement) change.}

State-of-the-art detects and blocks outgoing A\&T HTTP/S requests by using manually curated filter lists (e.g. EasyList), and recently, using machine learning approaches. The major bottleneck of both filter lists and classifiers is that they rely on experts and the community to inspect traffic and manually create filter list rules that can then be used to block traffic or label ground truth datasets. We propose NoMoATS -- a system that removes this bottleneck by reducing the daunting task of manually creating filter rules, to the much easier and scalable task of labeling A\&T libraries. Our system leverages stack trace analysis to automatically label which network requests are generated by A\&T libraries. Using NoMoATS, we collect and label a new mobile traffic dataset. We use this dataset to train decision tree classifiers, which can be applied in real-time on the mobile device and achieve an average F-score of 93\%. We show that both our automatic labeling and our classifiers discover thousands of requests destined to hundreds of different hosts, previously undetected by popular filter lists. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first to (1) automatically label which mobile network requests are engaged in A\&T, while requiring to only manually label libraries to their purpose and (2) apply on-device machine learning classifiers that operate at the granularity of URLs, can inspect connections across all apps, and detect not only ads, but also tracking.}

  abstract = {The construct of values is central to many fields in the social sciences and humanities. The last two decades have seen a growing body of psychological research that investigates the content, structure and consequences of personal values in many cultures. Taking a cross-cultural perspective we review, organize and integrate research on personal values, and point to some of the main findings that this research has yielded. Personal values are subjective in nature, and reflect what people think and state about themselves. Consequently, both researchers and laymen sometimes question the usefulness of personal values in influencing action. Yet, self-reported values predict a large variety of attitudes, preferences and overt behaviours. Individuals act in ways that allow them to express their important values and attain the goals underlying them. Thus, understanding personal values means understanding human behaviour.},

The present paper aimed (a) to provide a systematic review of the published literature regarding current practices of the scale development process, (b) to assess the main limitations reported by the authors in these processes, and (c) to provide a set of recommendations for best practices in future scale development research. Papers were selected in September 2015, with the search terms ``scale development'' and ``limitations'' from three databases: Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, with no time restriction. We evaluated 105 studies published between 1976 and 2015. The analysis considered the three basic steps in scale development: item generation, theoretical analysis, and psychometric analysis. The study identified ten main types of limitation in these practices reported in the literature: sample characteristic limitations, methodological limitations, psychometric limitations, qualitative research limitations, missing data, social desirability bias, item limitations, brevity of the scale, difficulty controlling all variables, and lack of manual instructions. Considering these results, various studies analyzed in this review clearly identified methodological weaknesses in the scale development process (e.g., smaller sample sizes in psychometric analysis), but only a few researchers recognized and recorded these limitations. We hope that a systematic knowledge of the difficulties usually reported in scale development will help future researchers to recognize their own limitations and especially to make the most appropriate choices among different conceptions and methodological strategies.},

In addition, this study examined the impact of perceived PC violations on employees' feelings of trust in top management and affective organizational commitment. A total of 251 participants filled out a Web questionnaire. Results were consistent with the theoretical perspective, as feelings of e-mail privacy were linked to perceived PC violations and trust in top management. These perceptions, in turn, were related to employees' feelings of affective commitment.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

As hypothesized, Agreeableness correlates most positively with benevolence and tradition values, Openness with self-direction and universalism values, Extroversion with achievement and stimulation values, and Conscientiousness with achievement and conformity values. Correlations of values with facets of the five factors reveal nuances of the facets and clarify ambiguities in the meanings of the factors. Values and personality traits exhibit different patterns of correlation with religiosity and positive affect. Findings support the idea that the influence of values on behavior depends more on cognitive control than does the influence of traits.},

As a result, one user's decisions regarding app permissions can expose the information of other parties. However, research typically focuses on consequences of privacy-related decisions only for the user who makes the decisions. Work on the impact of these decisions on the privacy of others is still relatively scant. We fill this gap with an online study that extends prior work on interdependent privacy in social networking sites to the context of smartphone permissions. Our findings indicate that people typically give less consideration to the implications of their actions for the privacy of others compared to the impact on themselves. However, we found that priming people with information that features others can help reduce this discrepancy. We apply this insight to offer suggestions for enhancing permission-specification interfaces and system architectures to accommodate interdependent privacy.},

Currently, many SEM practitioners are having difficulty articulating the causal content of SEM and are seeking foundational answers. Recent developments in the areas of graphical models and the logic of causality show potential for alleviating such difficulties and, thus, revitalizing structural equations as the primary language of causal modeling. This article summarizes several of these developments, including the prediction of vanishing partial correlations, model testing, model equivalence, parametric and nonparametric identifiability, control of confounding, and covariate selection. These developments clarify the causal and statistical components of SEMs and the role of SEM in the empirical sciences.},

Which values relate more strongly to behavior than others? Do relations among different values and behaviors exhibit a meaningful overall structure? If so, how to explain this? We find that stimulation and tradition values relate strongly to the behaviors that express them; hedonism, power, universalism, and self-direction values relate moderately; and security, conformity, achievement, and benevolence values relate only marginally. Additional findings suggest that these differences in value-behavior relations may stem from normative pressures to perform certain behaviors. Such findings imply that values motivate behavior, but the relation between values and behaviors is partly obscured by norms. Relations among behaviors, among values, and jointly among values and behavior exhibit a similar structure. The motivational conflicts and congruities postulated by the theory of values can account for this shared structure.},

  abstract = {Privacy protection from surreptitious video recordings is an important societal challenge. We desire a computer vision system (e.g., a robot) that can recognize human activities and assist our daily life, yet ensure that it is not recording video that may invade our privacy. This paper presents a fundamental approach to address such contradicting objectives: human activity recognition while only using extreme low-resolution (e.g., 16x12) anonymized videos. We introduce the paradigm of inverse super resolution (ISR), the concept of learning the optimal set of image transformations to generate multiple low-resolution (LR) training videos from a single video. Our ISR learns different types of sub-pixel transformations optimized for the activity classification, allowing the classifier to best take advantage of existing high-resolution videos (e.g., YouTube videos) by creating multiple LR training videos tailored for the problem. We experimentally confirm that the paradigm of inverse super resolution is able to benefit activity recognition from extreme low-resolution videos.}

Hierarchical regression models analyzed data from a national sample of 419 adult Internet users. The analyses showed strong predictive powers of user knowledge, as indicated by the three discrete dimensions, on privacy control behavior. However, the findings were mixed when accounting for the interaction between knowledge and Internet experiences. There were limitations on the extents of knowledge and action related to personalized information. Furthermore, those limitations divided with sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, and education. Ramifications for the current status of the FTC policy are discussed.},

  abstract = {This research addresses the tensions that arise between the collection and use of personal information that people provide in the course of most consumer transactions, and privacy. In today's electronic world, the competitive strategies of successful firms increasingly depend on vast amounts of customer data. Ironically, the same information practices that provide value to organizations also raise privacy concerns for individuals. This study hypothesized that organizations can address these privacy concerns and gain business advantage through customer retention by observing procedural fairness: customers will be willing to disclose personal information and have that information subsequently used to create consumer profiles for business use when there are fair procedures in place to protect individual privacy. Because customer relationships are characterized by social distance, customers must depend on strangers to act on their behalf. Procedural fairness serves as an intermediary to build trust when interchangeable organizational agents exercise considerable delegated power on behalf of customers who cannot specify or constrain their behavior. Our hypothesis was supported as we found that when customers are explicitly told that fair information practices are employed, privacy concerns do not distinguish consumers who are willing to be profiled from those who are unwilling to have their personal information used in this way.},

Generally, causal effects are not identifiable if the confounders are missing not at random. In this article we propose a novel framework for nonparametric identification of causal effects with confounders subject to an outcome-independent missingness, which means that the missing data mechanism is independent of the outcome, given the treatment and possibly missing confounders. We then propose a nonparametric two-stage least squares estimator and a parametric estimator for causal effects.},

  abstract = {Inferring causal effects of treatments is a central goal in many disciplines. The potential outcomes framework is a main statistical approach to causal inference, in which a causal effect is defined as a comparison of the potential outcomes of the same units under different treatment conditions. Because for each unit at most one of the potential outcomes is observed and the rest are missing, causal inference is inherently a missing data problem. Indeed, there is a close analogy in the terminology and the inferential framework between causal inference and missing data. Despite the intrinsic connection between the two subjects, statistical analyses of causal inference and missing data also have marked differences in aims, settings and methods. This article provides a systematic review of causal inference from the missing data perspective. Focusing on ignorable treatment assignment mechanisms, we discuss a wide range of causal inference methods that have analogues in missing data analysis, such as imputation, inverse probability weighting and doubly robust methods. Under each of the three modes of inference---Frequentist, Bayesian and Fisherian randomization---we present the general structure of inference for both finite-sample and super-population estimands, and illustrate via specific examples. We identify open questions to motivate more research to bridge the two fields.}

For example, despite 15 years of development, standard Java libraries still suffer from missing and incorrectly applied permission checks, which enable untrusted applications to execute native calls or modify private class variables without authorization. Previous techniques for static verification of authorization enforcement rely on manually specified policies or attempt to infer the policy by code-mining. Neither approach guarantees that the policy used for verification is correct.                            In this paper, we exploit the fact that many modern APIs have               multiple, independent               implementations. Our flow- and context-sensitive analysis takes as input an API, multiple implementations thereof, and the definitions of security checks and security-sensitive events. For each API entry point, the analysis computes the security policies enforced by the checks before security-sensitive events such as native method calls and API returns, compares these policies across implementations, and reports the differences. Unlike code-mining, this technique finds missing checks even if they are part of a rare pattern. Security-policy differencing has no intrinsic false positives: implementations of the same API               must               enforce the same policy, or at least one of them is wrong!                          Our analysis finds 20 new, confirmed security vulnerabilities and 11 interoperability bugs in the Sun, Harmony, and Classpath implementations of the Java Class Library, many of which were missed by prior analyses. These problems manifest in 499 entry points in these mature, well-studied libraries. Multiple API implementations are proliferating due to cloud-based software services and standardization of library interfaces. Comparing software implementations for consistency is a new approach to discovering "deep" bugs in them.},

While such practice may not be at odds with Twitter's terms of service, we argue there is a need to interpret these through the lens of social science research methods that imply a more reflexive ethical approach than provided in `legal' accounts of the permissible use of these data in research publications. To challenge some existing practice in Twitter-based research, this article brings to the fore: (1) views of Twitter users through analysis of online survey data; (2) the effect of context collapse and online disinhibition on the behaviours of users; and (3) the publication of identifiable sensitive classifications derived from algorithms.},

However, the availability of public social media data has also presented ethical challenges. As the research community works to create ethical norms, we should be considering users' concerns as well. With this in mind, we report on an exploratory survey of Twitter users' perceptions of the use of tweets in research. Within our survey sample, few users were previously aware that their public tweets could be used by researchers, and the majority felt that researchers should not be able to use tweets without consent. However, we find that these attitudes are highly contextual, depending on factors such as how the research is conducted or disseminated, who is conducting it, and what the study is about. The findings of this study point to potential best practices for researchers conducting observation and analysis of public data.},

Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1;               N               \,=\,409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study~was predictive of greater~belief in fake (but not real) news~posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total               N               \,=\,3884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news.},

We are motivated by the threat scenario where an image is used out of context to support a certain narrative.

We introduce several strategies for automatically retrieving convincing images for a given caption, capturing cases with inconsistent entities or semantic context. Our large-scale automatically generated NewsCLIPpings Dataset: (1) demonstrates that machine-driven image repurposing is now a realistic threat, and (2) provides samples that represent challenging instances of mismatch between text and image in news that are able to mislead humans. We benchmark several state-of-the-art multimodal models on our dataset and analyze their performance across different pretraining domains and visual backbones.},

Given the potential for widespread dissemination of this material, we examine the individual-level characteristics associated with sharing false articles during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. To do so, we uniquely link an original survey with respondents' sharing activity as recorded in Facebook profile data. First and foremost, we find that sharing this content was a relatively rare activity. Conservatives were more likely to share articles from fake news domains, which in 2016 were largely pro-Trump in orientation, than liberals or moderates. We also find a strong age effect, which persists after controlling for partisanship and ideology: On average, users over 65 shared nearly seven times as many articles from fake news domains as the youngest age group.},

Findings show that peer-mimicry contributes to the contagion process the most, followed by generalized reciprocity and direct mimicry.

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the spillover effects of offensive commenting in online community from the lens of emotional and behavioral contagion. Specifically, it examines the contagion of swearing -- a linguistic mannerism that conveys high-arousal emotion -- based upon two mechanisms of contagion: mimicry and social interaction effect. Design/methodology/approach The study performs a series of mixed-effect logistic regressions to investigate the contagious potential of offensive comments collected from YouTube in response to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign videos posted between January and April 2016. Findings The study examines non-random incidences of two types of swearing online: public and interpersonal. Findings suggest that a first-level (a.k.a. parent) comment's public swearing tends to trigger chains of interpersonal swearing in the second-level (a.k.a. child) comments. Meanwhile, among the child-comments, a sequentially preceding comment's swearing is contagious to the following comment only across the same swearing type. Based on the findings, the study concludes that offensive comments are contagious and have impact on shaping the community-wide linguistic norms of online user interactions. Originality/value The study discusses the ways in which an individual's display of offensiveness may influence and shape discursive cultures on the internet. This study delves into the mechanisms of text-based contagion by differentiating between mimicry effect and social interaction effect. While online emotional contagion research to this date has focused on the difference between positive and negative valence, internet research that specifically looks at the contagious potential of offensive expressions remains sparse.},

Especially when there is a national security alert, anti-government rumors can become weapons that thwart government crisis information management. A key element for any government's successful cyber-rumor management is to understand what makes citizens prone to engaging in cyber-rumors. We focus on citizens' cyber-rumoring tendency that arises within the larger context of a nation's governance over the Internet. Specifically, this study examines how citizen's assessment of government Internet surveillance influences their engagement with cyber-rumors during a homeland security threat. Two surveys in South Korea find that citizens' government Internet surveillance concerns increased their cyber-rumor sharing intention, and the effect was particularly significant during the period of homeland security threat. This paper reconsiders the efficacy of government Internet surveillance in mitigating cyber-rumor propagation among general public, and expands the discussions by introducing the logic of `distrust effect' on cyber-rumoring. Cyber-rumor monitoring through government Internet surveillance can be counterproductive to homeland security efforts unless government aligns its surveillance policy with citizens' informational norms on cyberspaces.},

The current study attempts to understand the ways in which swearing influences citizen-to-citizen news commenting online. Based on a large corpus of the 2-month user comments from 26 news websites in South Korea, the study examines swearing effects as well as its interplay with anonymity on garnering public attention and shaping other users? perceptions of the comments. Findings suggest that swearing generally has a positive effect on increasing user attention to comments as well as gaining other users? approvals. Comparisons between political and nonpolitical topics further suggest that swearing effect on gaining public attention is particularly prominent for political discussions. In contrast, the magnitude of change toward positive valence in public perception to comments is much greater for nonpolitical topics than for politics. From the findings, we conclude that an acceptable degree of swearing norms in online discussions vary across news topical arenas. The results also lead to discussions about the possibility of like-minded exposure to political comments as a default condition for online discussions. Finally, the study highlights the role of high-arousal emotions in shaping discursive participation in contemporary networked sociodigital environment.},

The results show that, while non-rumor narratives focus on policy-level responses to the threat situation in a similar manner to institutionalized opinion polling, rumors are less concerned with official responses, instead reflective of hegemonic tensions between anti-leftwing political sentiments and the counteractive accounts. Some rumors reveal the public's coping with fears in the form of humor, guesswork, or wishes. Online rumor analysis helps understand how the society's collective memories interact with the current situational uncertainty in shaping public opinions and sentiments.},

In this study, two mechanisms, a policy-driven and a voluntary approach, are examined for their conditional and interaction effects on reducing flaming in user comments online. Based on a large-scale, real-world data on political news comments in South Korea, the results suggest that whereas the policy-driven regulation does not reduce, and even increases, flaming, the voluntary approach significantly decreases it, especially among the moderate commenters. The findings are further speculated from an economic perspective by which transaction costs are perceived differently contingent on the ways in which anonymous commenting is regulated.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of concern about the proliferation of false and misleading news on social media1--4. Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5--7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy---and therefore they fail to implement a strongly~held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.},

Fact-checking has a significantly positive overall influence on political beliefs (d = 0.29), but the effects gradually weaken when using ``truth scales,'' refuting only parts of a claim, and fact-checking campaign-related statements. Likewise, the ability to correct political misinformation with fact-checking is substantially attenuated by participants' preexisting beliefs, ideology, and knowledge. The study concludes with a discussion of the fact-checking literature in light of current gaps and future opportunities.},

Yet, a rigorous examination of the assumptions underlying this data-price analogy is seriously lacking. Even more important, almost no empirical work has been done in this area. This Article contributes to the debate by filling these important gaps in the literature. After presenting a theoretical examination of the relationship between privacy and competition, we provide empirical evidence on the relationship between market power and privacy. First, using data from PrivacyGrade.org, we find no relationship between privacy grades and our proxies for market power. Second, we collected website traffic data from SimilarWeb and matched it to DuckDuckGo's privacy ratings for sites in thirty-seven website categories. Again, the data suggest no systematic relationship between privacy ratings and market concentration. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results challenge conventional wisdom, suggesting that antitrust is a poor tool to address perceived privacy problems. Instead, if markets produce less than optimal levels of privacy, it is likely due to informational problems that have no relationship with competition. We suggest that absent specific allegations on (1) the causal link between conduct and degraded privacy, and (2) the lack of benefits from increased data collection, antitrust complaints that merely assert a causal link between privacy reductions and market power should not survive the Twombly-Iqbal plausibility standard. Further, we conclude that privacy regulation and competition policy might be complementary, but only in one direction: consumer protection designed to increase consumer access to information about firms' privacy practices---and firms' ability to credibly commit to these promises---could help foster competition over privacy, but the converse is not true.},

Based on such considerations, this article aims to provide an overview of this cryptocurrency, from the perspective of conducting a systematic review of the literature dedicated to the economic and environmental impact of Bitcoin. Using peer-reviewed articles collected from academic databases, we aimed at synthesizing and critically evaluating the points of view in the scientific literature regarding the doctrinal source of the emergence of Bitcoin, the identity of this cryptocurrency from an economic point of view, following its implications on the economic and social environment. Subsequently, this research offers the opportunity of evaluating the level of knowledge considering the impact of Bitcoin mining process on the environment from the perspective of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions, in order to finally analyze Bitcoin regulation and identify possible solutions to reduce the negative impact on the environment and beyond. The findings suggest that, despite high energy consumption and adverse environmental impact, Bitcoin continues to be an instrument used in the economic environment for a variety of purposes. Moreover, the trend of regulating it in various countries shows that the use of Bitcoin is beginning to gain some legitimacy, despite criticism against this cryptocurrency.},

Better ways of defining and measuring these expressions may therefore be useful both in understanding how social identity is expressed in text, and how the self is presented on Twitter. To this end, the present work makes three contributions. First, using qualitative methods, we identify and define the concept of a personal identifier, which is more representative of the ways in which identity is signaled in Twitter bios. Second, we propose a method to extract all personal identifiers expressed in a given bio. Finally, we present a series of validation analyses that explore the strengths and limitations of our proposed method. Our work opens up exciting new opportunities at the intersection between the social psychological study of social identity and the study of how we compose the self through markers of identity on Twitter and in social media more generally.},

  abstract = {Cloud storage services, like Dropbox and Google Drive, have growing ecosystems of 3rd party apps that are designed to work with users' cloud files. Such apps often request full access to users' files, including files shared with collaborators. Hence, whenever a user grants access to a new vendor, she is inflicting a privacy loss on herself and on her collaborators too. Based on analyzing a real dataset of 183 Google Drive users and 131 third party apps, we discover that collaborators inflict a privacy loss which is at least 39\% higher than what users themselves cause. We take a step toward minimizing this loss by introducing the concept of History- based decisions. Simply put, users are informed at decision time about the vendors which have been previously granted access to their data. Thus, they can reduce their privacy loss by not installing apps from new vendors whenever possible. Next, we realize this concept by introducing a new privacy indicator, which can be integrated within the cloud apps' authorization interface. Via a web experiment with 141 participants recruited from CrowdFlower, we show that our privacy indicator can significantly increase the user's likelihood of choosing the app that minimizes her privacy loss. Finally, we explore the network effect of History-based decisions via a simulation on top of large collaboration networks. We demonstrate that adopting such a decision- making process is capable of reducing the growth of user privacy loss by 40\% in a Google Drive-based network and by 70\% in an author collaboration network. This is despite the fact that we neither assume that users cooperate nor that they exhibit altruistic behavior. To our knowledge, our work is the first to provide quantifiable evidence of the privacy risk that collaborators pose in cloud apps. We are also the first to mitigate this problem via a usable privacy approach.},

We found that by 8-years-old children were indeed more likely to judge that users own the personal information they share with apps than they were to judge that users own the general information they share with them. However, younger children judged that the general information was owned by the user at similar rates to the personal information. Further exploration of our data suggests these changes are likely driven by beliefs about the ownership of general information.},

  abstract = {Narrow self-interest is often used as a simplifying assumption when studying people making decisions in social contexts. Nonetheless, people exhibit a wide range of different motivations when choosing unilaterally among interdependent outcomes. Measuring the magnitude of the concern people have for others, sometimes called Social Value Orientation (SVO), has been an interest of many social scientists for decades and several different measurement methods have been developed so far. Here we introduce a new measure of SVO that has several advantages over existent methods. A detailed description of the new measurement method is presented, along with norming data that provide evidence of its solid psychometric properties. We conclude with a brief discussion of the research streams that would benefit from a more sensitive and higher resolution measure of SVO, and extend an invitation to others to use this new measure which is freely available.},

  abstract = {In this article, I examine how nudging powered by Big Data relates to both negative and positive liberty. I focus in particular on how liberty is affected by appeals to irrational mechanisms. I conclude that it is problematic to use liberty as an argument for nudging. Such an argument would have to be based on the concept of positive liberty, empowerment and emancipation from irrationality, but I argue that even stronger arguments against nudging can be built on the same conception of liberty. I consider Big Data-powered nudging to have the potential to be both manipulative and coercive, and believe that we should be wary of the effects such efforts have on liberty. As I consider liberty to be part of what makes a good society, this becomes an effort to analyse one aspect of the effects of technology on society in general. While I do not accept arguments in favour of nudging based on liberty, it is easier to see that arguments based on utility could support nudging. I do not evaluate what the proper trade-off is between utility and liberty in this article, and it is obvious that, at times, utility trumps an absolute demand for liberty. However, I argue in favour of transparent traditional regulation and rational persuasion instead of nudging, when these approaches can serve the same purposes. Should we choose to nudge, we should not euphemise our efforts by claiming that we do so on behalf of freedom.},

  abstract = {Privacy relates to individuals and their ability to keep certain aspects of themselves away from other individuals and organisations. This leads both proponents and opponents of liberalism to argue that liberalism involves allowing individuals to determine for themselves the level of privacy they desire. If they are given adequate information and the ability to choose, the results are argued to be legitimate, even if individuals choose to bargain away all or most of their privacy in return for convenience, economic benefits, etc. However, the individualistic approach to privacy is insufficient, due to a set of externalities and information leakages involved in privacy issues. A crucial aspect of privacy is that it is an aggregate public good, and recognising this lets us see why government intervention is both beneficial and necessary for securing the provision of optimal levels of privacy. This conception of privacy enables us to treat it as a good that is underprovided due to market failure. The article shows how liberals can justify government interference for the protection of privacy by relying on the avoidance of harm, and not on paternalism or other arguments not easily reconcilable with liberalism.},

We show that the collected browsing data can produce accurate predictions of personal information that is valuable for advertisers, such as age or gender. Because Facebook users reveal their demographic information to the platform, and because the browsing behavior of users and non-users of Facebook overlaps, users impose a data externality on non-users by allowing Facebook to infer their personal information.},

This has led some researchers to dismiss the search for causes as "cocktail party chatter" that is outside the realm of science. We argue here that the search for causes can be understood within traditional statistical frameworks as a part of model checking and hypothesis generation. We argue that it can make sense to ask questions about the causes of effects, but the answers to these questions will be in terms of effects of causes.},

The complexity of today's open-source supply chains results in a significant attack surface, giving attackers numerous opportunities to reach the goal of injecting malicious code into open-source artifacts such that it is downloaded and executed by victims. This work proposes a general taxonomy for attacks on open-source supply chains, independent of specific programming languages or ecosystems, and covering all supply chain stages from code contributions to package distribution. Taking the form of an attack tree, it covers 107 unique vectors, linked to 94 real-world incidents, and mapped to 33 mitigating safeguards. User surveys conducted with 17 domain experts and 134 software developers positively validated the correctness, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of the taxonomy, as well as its suitability for various use-cases. Survey participants also assessed the utility and costs of the identified safeguards, and whether they are used.},

  abstract = {Auditing, a central pillar of operating system security, has only recently come into its own as an active area of public research. This resurgent interest is due in large part to the notion of data provenance, a technique that iteratively parses audit log entries into a dependency graph that explains the history of system execution. Provenance facilitates precise threat detection and investigation through causal analysis of sophisticated intrusion behaviors. However, the absence of a foundational audit literature, combined with the rapid publication of recent findings, makes it difficult to gain a holistic picture of advancements and open challenges in the area.  In this work, we survey and categorize the provenance-based system auditing literature, distilling contributions into a layered taxonomy based on the audit log capture and analysis pipeline. Recognizing that the Reduction Layer remains a key obstacle to the further proliferation of causal analysis technologies, we delve further on this issue by conducting an ambitious independent evaluation of 8 exemplar reduction techniques against the recently-released DARPA Transparent Computing datasets. Our experiments uncover that past approaches frequently prune an overlapping set of activities from audit logs, reducing the synergistic benefits from applying them in tandem; further, we observe an inverse relation between storage efficiency and anomaly detection performance. However, we also observe that log reduction techniques are able to synergize effectively with data compression, potentially reducing log retention costs by multiple orders of magnitude. We conclude by discussing promising future directions for the field.},

Prior work has analyzed the overall software vulnerability ecosystem as well as patching processes within organizations, but not how these two are connected. We investigate this missing link through semi-structured interviews with 22 organizations in critical infrastructure and government services. We analyse where in these organizations the responsibility is allocated to collect and triage information about software vulnerabilities, and find that none of our respondents is acquiring such information comprehensively, not even in a reduced and aggregated form like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). This means that information on known vulnerabilities will be missed, even in critical infrastructure organizations. We observe that organizations apply implicit and explicit coping mechanisms to reduce their intake of vulnerability information, and identify three trade-offs in these strategies: independence, pro-activeness and formalization. Although our respondents' behavior is in conflict with the widely accepted security advice to collect comprehensive vulnerability information about active systems, no respondents re- call having experienced a security incident that was associated with missing information on a known software vulnerability. This suggests that, given scarce resources, reducing the intake of vulnerability information by up to 95\% can be considered a rational strategy. Our findings raise questions about the allocation of responsibility and accountability for finding vulnerable systems, as well as suggest changing expectations around collecting vulnerability information.},

Our analysis reveals that users' security and privacy attitudes, manifested in the levels of concern and degree to which they incorporate protective strategies, are shaped by multi-dimensional considerations. Users' attitudes evolve according to changing contextual factors, such as adoption phases, and how they become aware of these factors. Further, we describe how online discourse about security and privacy risks and protections contributes to individual and collective attitude development. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to improve smart home designs, support users' attitude development, facilitate information exchange, and guide future research regarding smart home security and privacy.},

Although web extensions inform users of their data practices via multiple forms of notices, prior work has overlooked the critical gap between the actual data practices and the published privacy notices of browser extensions. To fill this gap, we propose ExtPrivA that automatically detects the inconsistencies between browser extensions' data collection and their privacy disclosures. From the privacy policies and Dashboard disclosures, ExtPrivA extracts privacy statements to have a clear interpretation of the privacy practices of an extension. It emulates user interactions to trigger the extension's functionalities and analyzes the initiators of network requests to accurately extract the users' data transferred by the extension from the browser to external servers. Our end-to-end evaluation has shown ExtPrivA to detect inconsistencies between the privacy disclosures and data-collection behavior with an 85\% precision. In a large-scale study of 47.2k extensions on the Chrome Web Store, we found 820 extensions with 1,290 flows that are inconsistent with their privacy statements. Even worse, we have found 525 pairs of contradictory privacy statements in the Dashboard disclosures and privacy policies of 360 extensions. These discrepancies between the privacy disclosures and the actual data-collection behavior are deemed as serious violations of the Store's policies. Our findings highlight the critical issues in the privacy disclosures of browser extensions that potentially mislead, and even pose high privacy risks to, end-users.},

We also identify relevant topics, of which epistemic norms, privacy, and digital citizenship appeared most often. While teachers leverage traditional and novel teaching strategies including discussions (treating current events as case studies), gamified activities, and content creation, many challenges remain. For example, teachers hesitate to discuss current events out of concern for appearing partisan and angering parents; cyber hygiene instruction appears very ineffective at educating youth and promoting safer online behavior; and generational differences make it difficult for teachers to connect with students. Based on the study results, we offer practical suggestions for educators, school administrators, and cybersecurity practitioners to improve youth education on cybersecurity and AI ethics.},

We present an empirical study with 14 SHC users to understand how these devices are used and integrated within everyday life. Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews, we investigate users' motivations, practices, privacy concerns, and social negotiations. Our findings highlight the SHC as a perceptually powerful and spatially sensitive device that enables a variety of surveillant uses outside of basic home security---from formally surveilling domestic workers, to casually spying on neighbors, to capturing memories. We categorize surveillant SHC uses, clarify distinctions between primary and non-primary users, and highlight under-considered design directions for addressing power imbalances among primary and non-primary users.},

These photos, when shared online, can reach a large number of viewers and potentially undermine the bystanders' privacy. Furthermore, recent developments in computer vision and machine learning can be used by online platforms to identify and track individuals. To combat this problem, researchers have proposed technical solutions that require bystanders to be proactive and use specific devices or applications to broadcast their privacy policy and identifying information to locate them in an image.We explore the prospect of a different approach - identifying bystanders solely based on the visual information present in an image. Through an online user study, we catalog the rationale humans use to classify subjects and bystanders in an image, and systematically validate a set of intuitive concepts (such as intentionally posing for a photo) that can be used to automatically identify bystanders. Using image data, we infer those concepts and then use them to train several classifier models. We extensively evaluate the models and compare them with human raters. On our initial dataset, with a 10-fold cross validation, our best model achieves a mean detection accuracy of 93\% for images when human raters have 100\% agreement on the class label and 80\% when the agreement is only 67\%. We validate this model on a completely different dataset and achieve similar results, demonstrating that our model generalizes well.},

In addition to their main subject matter, photographs often capture various incidental information that could harm people's privacy. While blurring and other image filters may help obscure private content, they also often affect the utility and aesthetics of the photos, which is important since images shared in social media are mainly for human consumption. Existing studies of privacy-enhancing image filters either primarily focus on obscuring faces, or do not systematically study how filters affect image utility. To understand the trade-offs when obscuring various sensitive aspects of images, we study eleven filters applied to obfuscate twenty different objects and attributes, and evaluate how effectively they protect privacy and preserve image quality for human viewers.},

While participants across conditions indicated a lower likelihood of sharing photos that portrayed people negatively, they - surprisingly - reported a higher likelihood of sharing photos when primed to consider the privacy of the person in the photo. Frequent photo sharers on real-world social media platforms and people without strong personal privacy preferences were especially likely to want to share photos in the experiment, regardless of how the photo portrayed the subject. A follow-up study with 100 participants explaining their responses revealed that the Privacy condition led to a lack of concern with others' privacy. These findings suggest that developing interventions for reducing photo sharing and protecting the privacy of others is a multivariate problem in which seemingly obvious solutions can sometimes go awry.},

In two treatment conditions, participants were either primed to imagine themselves as the photo-subjects or to consider the photo-subjects' privacy before sharing memes. We found that participants who frequently use aggressive and self-deprecating humor were more likely to violate others' privacy by sharing photos. We also replicated the interventions' paradoxical effects -- increasing sharing likelihood -- as reported in earlier work and identified the subgroups that demonstrated this behavior through interaction analyses. When primed to consider the subjects' privacy, only humor deniers (participants who use humor infrequently) demonstrated increased sharing. In contrast, when imagining themselves as the photo-subjects, humor deniers, unlike other participants, did not increase the sharing of photos.},

  abstract = {Education technologies (EdTech) are becoming pervasive due to their cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and scalability. They also experienced accelerated market growth during the recent pandemic. EdTech collects massive amounts of students' behavioral and (sensitive) demographic data, often justified by the potential to help students by personalizing education. Researchers voiced concerns regarding privacy and data abuses (e.g., targeted advertising) in the absence of clearly defined data collection and sharing policies. However, technical contributions to alleviating students' privacy risks have been scarce. In this paper, we argue against collecting demographic data by showing that gender---a widely used demographic feature---does not causally affect students' course performance: arguably the most popular target of predictive models. Then, we show that gender can be inferred from behavioral data; thus, simply leaving them out does not protect students' privacy. Combining a feature selection mechanism with an adversarial censoring technique, we propose a novel approach to create a `private' version of a dataset comprising of fewer features that predict the target without revealing the gender, and are interpretive. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a public dataset to demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our mechanism.},

Disclosure of information about others may precipitate unanticipated consequences such as violating the privacy of another individual. Previous social network site (SNS) research has examined self-disclosure, this research examines the disclosure of information about others (DIO), building upon the theory of planned behavior and through the lens of Rest's ethical decision making model. A person's concern about others' privacy (COP) when he/she wants to share information about them is different from concern for himself/herself. The authors tested the posited model, using data collected with a survey instrument. Findings show that the COP, and attitude toward using SNSs influence the intention to disclose information about others. Also, COP is explained by social identity, agreeableness, extraversion, opinion leadership, sensitive information disclosure control, and prior privacy invasions. Social norms do not influence intentions to disclose information about others. Results indicate males have higher concern about others' privacy than females. This research contributes to the understanding of ethical choices of information disclosure within SNSs. Findings can help SNS developers improve privacy practices, protect sensitive third-party information, and improve user satisfaction.},

Despite the technical and regulatory mechanisms that are supposedly meant to empower users to manage their privacy, we found that users express an overarching feeling of resignation regarding privacy matters. Because these apps provide convenience and other benefits, as one participant put it, ``there is a very fine line'' that marks the divide between feeling empowered in the use of technology and coping with the discomfort and creepiness arising from invasive app behavior. Participants consistently expressed being resigned to disclose data even as they accepted personal responsibility for their own privacy. We apply the findings to discuss the limits of empowerment as a design logic for privacy-oriented solutions.},

We conclude that institutions of higher education are currently ill-equipped to protect students and faculty required to use the Canvas Instructure LMS from data harvesting or exploitation. We challenge inevitability narratives and call for greater public awareness concerning the use of predictive analytics, impacts of algorithmic bias, need for algorithmic transparency, and enactment of ethical and legal protections for users who are required to use such software platforms.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated the viability of using crowdsourcing as a tool for evaluating the truthfulness of public statements. Under certain conditions such as: (1) having a balanced set of workers with different backgrounds and cognitive abilities; (2) using an adequate set of mechanisms to control the quality of the collected data; and (3) using a coarse grained assessment scale, the crowd can provide reliable identification of fake news. However, fake news are a subtle matter: statements can be just biased (``cherrypicked''), imprecise, wrong, etc. and the unidimensional truth scale used in existing work cannot account for such differences. In this paper we propose a multidimensional notion of truthfulness and we ask the crowd workers to assess seven different dimensions of truthfulness selected based on existing literature: Correctness, Neutrality, Comprehensibility, Precision, Completeness, Speaker's Trustworthiness, and Informativeness. We deploy a set of quality control mechanisms to ensure that the thousands of assessments collected on 180 publicly available fact-checked statements distributed over two datasets are of adequate quality, including a custom search engine used by the crowd workers to find web pages supporting their truthfulness assessments. A comprehensive analysis of crowdsourced judgments shows that: (1) the crowdsourced assessments are reliable when compared to an expert-provided gold standard; (2) the proposed dimensions of truthfulness capture independent pieces of information; (3) the crowdsourcing task can be easily learned by the workers; and (4) the resulting assessments provide a useful basis for a more complete estimation of statement truthfulness.},

  abstract = {The wide spread of misinformation contributes to information consumers' excessed distrust of online information. To cope, information consumers are often actively involved in checking the credibility of information through self-researching or seeking help and opinions from experts and peers. While previous studies investigated the factors that affect people's perceptions of information credibility and how laypeople's judgements compare to experts, little is known about how the information credibility assessment work is performed and cooperated by individuals and communities in real-life, natural online environments. Through a qualitative study of an online community, r/DebunkThis, which is dedicated to information debunking, we found that online information debunking rarely followed a linear and straightforward path. Rather, community members, including the debunkers and the original posters, constantly negotiated, and interacted with each other to determine what to debunk and how to debunk. Individuals adopted various strategies to debunk information, such as questioning the credibility of the information source and citing authoritative external information. Community members supplemented with details and explanations, corrected others, requested clarifications, summarized high-level knowledge and skills, and interacted socially based on individuals' debunking explanations. Our study results broaden the understanding of debunking not only as an outcome but also as a learning and social process for community members to learn high-level debunking skills and form and enforce community rules. We provide implications for designing community and crowd-based information debunking systems which should recognize the complex, cooperative, and socially situated work of community and crowd debunkers. The design of such systems should therefore support not only labeling information as correct or not or simply sharing alternative information sources, but also community interactions and learning processes, as well as recognizing the labor of community debunkers.},

However, there is a severe shortage of fact-checkers; an efficient way to scale fact-checking is desperately needed, especially in pandemics like COVID-19. In this study, we focus on spontaneous debunking by social media users, which has been missed in existing research despite its indicated usefulness for fact-checking and countering false information. Specifically, we characterize the tweets with false information, or fake tweets, that tend to be debunked and Twitter users who often debunk fake tweets. For this analysis, we create a comprehensive dataset of responses to fake tweets, annotate a subset of them, and build a classification model for detecting debunking behaviors. We find that most fake tweets are left undebunked, spontaneous debunking is slower than other forms of responses, and spontaneous debunking exhibits partisanship in political topics.  These results provide actionable insights into utilizing spontaneous debunking to scale conventional fact-checking, thereby supplementing existing research from a new perspective.}

Instructors expressed frustration with the ways that data displays undermined their existing pedagogical strategies. They were stymied by a lack of clarity on how data is assembled and imbued with meaning, which limited their own sensemaking about the data. They also expressed concerns about how the dashboards facilitated data collection about their instructional planning and decision-making.},

Existing studies of privacy perceptions and behavior focus on overall tendencies toward privacy, but few have examined the context-specific factors in privacy decision making. We conducted a survey on Mechanical Turk (N=401) based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to measure the way users' perceptions of privacy factors and intent to disclose information are affected by three situational factors embodied hypothetical scenarios: information type, recipients' role, and trust source. Results showed a positive relationship between subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, and between each of these and situational privacy attitude; all three constructs are significantly positively associated with intent to disclose. These findings also suggest that, situational factors predict participants' privacy decisions through their influence on the TPB constructs.},

However, without a proper understanding of how these technologies work, individuals may make incorrect data-sharing decisions. A design gap exists in effectively explaining the workings of DP technologies, such as Local DP, to users. Our research aimed to fill this gap by designing a visual explanatory illustration. We conducted an online survey with 228 participants to assess the impact of different explanation designs on understanding DP and data-sharing decisions. Our study found that the visual illustration was more effective than the text-based description in helping individuals comprehend Local DP's privacy protection against large organizations, with the illustration group exhibiting an increase of 51.4\% in comprehension test scores. The study also found that improved knowledge of privacy-enhancing technologies does not guarantee willingness to share protected data. Building on our study insights, future research could explore integrating natural language processing technologies and incorporating behavioral intervention designs for more effective explanations of privacy protection, thereby preventing misinformed data-sharing decisions.},

  abstract = {Academic studies typically view privacy threats as originating solely from organizations. With the rise of social media, such a view is incomplete because consumers increasingly face risks from peers' misuse of data. In this paper, we study information privacy in the context of peer relationships on commercial social media sites. We develop a model that considers relationships between the constructs of privacy experiences, privacy awareness, trust, risk, and benefits and how those relationships impact individuals' disclosure behaviors. We test the model by creating a survey that includes a number of measures that were taken directly from or were closely based on measures from prior studies. We conduct seven pilot tests of undergraduate students in order to validate the survey items. Working with the online survey firm Qualtrics, we gather a dataset of 314 Facebook users' responses to our validated survey, and we test our model using partial least squares techniques. We find that both privacy experiences and privacy awareness are quite significant predictors of privacy concerns. We also find that trust, risk, benefits, and privacy concerns work together to explain a large amount (37\%) of the variance in disclosure behaviors. We discuss implications for practice and for future research.},

In the current study, the authors examined the association between relationship closeness and forgiveness across six countries, including both traditionally individualistic---Italy, the Netherlands, the United States---and collectivistic cultures---Japan, China (and one country, Turkey, with both individualistic and collectivistic features). Results demonstrated that, cross-culturally, there was a robust positive association between closeness toward the offender and level of forgiveness, both for trait-forgiveness and offense-specific forgiveness. However, this association was weaker in the collectivistic countries, which may suggest that strong norms in these countries to maintain social harmony may partly weaken the role of closeness in forgiveness. Overall, the present findings are discussed in terms of the possible evolutionary origins of forgiveness and the role of individualism/collectivism in forgiveness.},

One factor that consistently positively impacts prosocial behavior is relationship status: Prosocial behavior is more likely toward kin than toward strangers. The interactions among stress, kin relationships, and prosocial behavior were examined in two separate experiments. In Study 1, 79 university students were asked to decide how much money to donate to family members, friends, or strangers, either under time pressure or with no time constraints. Participants donated more to close kin and friends than to strangers, but time pressure did not increase prosocial behavior. In Study 2, 94 university students completed the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G) or a control task, followed by a similar donation task as used in Study 1. Participants donated more to close kin and friends than to strangers, but stress did not influence donation amounts. These results do not support the hypothesis that stress due to time pressure or psychosocial factors increases prosocial behavior.},

We also examined medical students' PVs profile and gender differences in terms of PVs. All participants (               N               \,=\,398) were Italian, young (average age\,=\,19.62~years, SD\,=\,1.22), and unmarried; none had children. Zero-order correlations and hierarchical multiple regression models were performed to verify the association between PVs and empathy; in contrast, t-tests were run to explore gender differences in scoring on PVs. Benevolence and Universalism correlated positively with both the emotional and cognitive dimensions of empathy, whereas Power, Achievement, Hedonism, and Security were negatively associated with empathy. The three most important PVs in the whole sample were Benevolence, Self-Direction, and Universalism. Male medical students outscored their female counterparts on Power, Achievement, and Hedonism, whereas female students outscored the males on Benevolence, Universalism, Conformity, and Tradition. Our findings highlight the importance of fostering self-transcending PVs and discouraging self-enhancing PVs in medical students during the early years of medical school, as a means of supporting other-oriented responses such as empathy in future doctors.},

They identify five facilitators of value change (priming, adaptation, identification, consistency maintenance, and direct persuasion) and consider the moderating role of culture in each. In addition, the authors discuss the roles of culture, personal values, and traits as general moderators of value change. Evidence on the structure of value change and the effects of age on value change are also reviewed.},

In an age of technology integration, this interdependence of data protection is becoming a major threat to privacy. Yet current regulation focuses on the sharing of information between two parties rather than multiactor situations. This study highlights how current policy inadequacies, illustrated by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, can be overcome by means of a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. Specifically, the authors introduce a new phenomenological framework to explain interdependent infringements. This framework builds on parallels between property and privacy and suggests that interdependent peer protection necessitates three hierarchical steps, ``the 3Rs'': realize, recognize, and respect. In response to observed failures at these steps, the authors identify four classes of intervention that constitute a toolbox addressing what can be done by marketers, regulators, and privacy organizations. While the first three classes of interventions address issues arising from the corresponding 3Rs, the authors specifically advocate for a fourth class of interventions that proposes radical alternatives that shift the responsibilities for privacy protection away from consumers.},

A privacy attack takes seemingly innocuous released information and uses it to discern the private details of individuals, thus demonstrating that such information compromises privacy. For example, re-identification attacks have shown that it is easy to link supposedly de-identified records to the identity of the individual concerned. This survey focuses on attacking aggregate data, such as statistics about how many individuals have a certain disease, genetic trait, or combination thereof. We consider two types of attacks: reconstruction attacks, which approximately determine a sensitive feature of all the individuals covered by the dataset, and tracing attacks, which determine whether or not a target individual's data are included in the dataset. We also discuss techniques from the differential privacy literature for releasing approximate aggregate statistics while provably thwarting any privacy attack.},

We studied people's reasons for and against adopting smart speakers, their privacy perceptions and concerns, and their privacy-seeking behaviors around smart speakers. We conducted a diary study and interviews with seventeen smart speaker users and interviews with seventeen non-users. We found that many non-users did not see the utility of smart speakers or did not trust speaker companies. In contrast, users express few privacy concerns, but their rationalizations indicate an incomplete understanding of privacy risks, a complicated trust relationship with speaker companies, and a reliance on the socio-technical context in which smart speakers reside. Users trade privacy for convenience with different levels of deliberation and privacy resignation. Privacy tensions arise between primary, secondary, and incidental users of smart speakers. Finally, current smart speaker privacy controls are rarely used, as they are not well-aligned with users' needs. Our findings can inform future smart speaker designs; in particular we recommend better integrating privacy controls into smart speaker interaction.},

  abstract = {With the rise of social networking sites (SNSs), individuals not only disclose personal information but also share private information concerning others online. While shared information is co-constructed by self and others, personal and collective privacy boundaries become blurred. Thus there is an increasing concern over information privacy beyond the individual perspective. However, limited research has empirically examined if individuals are concerned about privacy loss not only of their own but their social ties'; nor is there an established instrument for measuring the collective aspect of individuals' privacy concerns. In order to address this gap in existing literature, we propose a conceptual framework of individuals' collective privacy concerns in the context of SNSs. Drawing on the Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002), we suggest three dimensions of collective privacy concerns, namely, collective information access, control and diffusion. This is followed by the development and empirical validation of a preliminary scale of SNS collective privacy concerns (SNSCPC). Structural model analyses confirm the three-dimensional conceptualization of SNSCPC and reveal antecedents of SNS users' concerns over violations of the collective privacy boundaries. This paper serves as a starting point for theorizing privacy as a collective notion and for understanding online information disclosure as a result of social interaction and group influence.},

  abstract = {The lack of consumer confidence in information privacy has been identified as a major problem hampering the growth of e-commerce. Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions---namely, collection, control, and awareness---exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet.},

We model peer disclosure as the imposition of a negative externality on other people. Our model encompasses the benefits of posting information, positive externalities in the form of recognition and entertainment benefits due to others' sharing of information, and heterogeneous privacy preferences. We find that regulation of peer disclosure is necessary. We consider two candidate regulations, i.e., nudging and quotas. Nudging reduces user participation and privacy harm and sometimes improves social welfare. By contrast, imposing a quota often improves user participation, privacy protection, and social welfare. Adding a nudge on top of a quota does not bring additional benefits. We show that any regulation that uniformly controls the disclosure of sensitive and nonsensitive information will not serve the triple objectives of reducing privacy harm, increasing social welfare, and increasing information contribution. We derive a necessary condition for solutions that can fulfill these three objectives. We also compare the incentives of the platform owner and social planner and draw related managerial and policy implications.

  abstract = {Organizations often collect private data and release aggregate statistics for the public's benefit. If no steps toward preserving privacy are taken, adversaries may use released statistics to deduce unauthorized information about the individuals described in the private dataset. Differentially private algorithms address this challenge by slightly perturbing underlying statistics with noise, thereby mathematically limiting the amount of information that may be deduced from each data release. Properly calibrating these algorithms -- and in turn the disclosure risk for people described in the dataset -- requires a data curator to choose a value for a privacy budget parameter, \${$\varepsilon\$$}. However, there is little formal guidance for choosing \${$\varepsilon\$$}, a task that requires reasoning about the probabilistic privacy-utility trade-off. Furthermore, choosing \${$\varepsilon\$$} in the context of statistical inference requires reasoning about accuracy trade-offs in the presence of both measurement error and differential privacy (DP) noise. We present Visualizing Privacy (ViP), an interactive interface that visualizes relationships between \${$\varepsilon\$$}, accuracy, and disclosure risk to support setting and splitting \${$\varepsilon\$$} among queries. As a user adjusts \${$\varepsilon\$$}, ViP dynamically updates visualizations depicting expected accuracy and risk. ViP also has an inference setting, allowing a user to reason about the impact of DP noise on statistical inferences. Finally, we present results of a study where 16 research practitioners with little to no DP background completed a set of tasks related to setting \${$\varepsilon\$$} using both ViP and a control. We find that ViP helps participants more correctly answer questions related to judging the probability of where a DP-noised release is likely to fall and comparing between DP-noised and non-private confidence intervals.},

In recent years, a new definition of privacy called               k               -anonymity has gained popularity. In a               k               -anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least               k               - 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes.                                         In this article, we show using two simple attacks that a               k               -anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that               k               -anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called {$\ell$}-diversity that can defend against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for {$\ell$}-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that {$\ell$}-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},

We now believe this was a mistake, along with, we suspect, many colleagues in both the academic and policy communities. Results from such interventions have been disappointingly modest. But more importantly, they have guided many (though by no means all) behavioral scientists to frame policy problems in individual, not systemic, terms: To adopt what we call the ``i-frame,'' rather than the ``s-frame.'' The difference may be more consequential than i-frame advocates have realized, by deflecting attention and support away from s-frame policies. Indeed, highlighting the i-frame is a long-established objective of corporate opponents of concerted systemic action such as regulation and taxation. We illustrate our argument briefly for six policy problems, and in depth with the examples of climate change, obesity, retirement savings, and pollution from plastic waste. We argue that the most important way in which behavioral scientists can contribute to public policy is by employing their skills to develop and implement value-creating system-level change.},

However, tools which provide the strongest protections---such as Tor Browser---have struggled to achieve widespread adoption. This may be due to usability challenges, misconceptions, behavioral biases, or mere lack of awareness. In this study, we test the effectiveness of nudging interventions that encourage the adoption of Tor Browser. First, we test an informational nudge based on               protection motivation theory               (PMT), designed to raise awareness of Tor Browser and help participants form accurate perceptions of it. Next, we add an               action planning               implementation intention, designed to help participants identify opportunities for using Tor Browser. Finally, we add a               coping planning               implementation intention, designed to help participants overcome challenges to using Tor Browser, such as extreme website slowness. We test these nudges in a longitudinal field experiment with 537 participants. We find that our PMT-based intervention increased use of Tor Browser in both the short- and long-term. Our coping planning nudge also increased use of Tor Browser, but only in the week following our intervention. We did not find statistically significant evidence of our action planning nudge increasing use of Tor Browser. Our study contributes to a greater understanding of factors influencing the adoption of Tor Browser, and how nudges might be used to encourage the adoption of Tor Browser and similar privacy enhancing technologies.},

In contrast, predictions from a non-causal model can potentially be very wrong if we actively intervene on variables. Here, we propose to exploit this invariance of a prediction under a causal model for causal inference: given different experimental settings (e.g. various interventions) we collect all models that do show invariance in their predictive accuracy across settings and interventions. The causal model will be a member of this set of models with high probability. This approach yields valid confidence intervals for the causal relationships in quite general scenarios. We examine the example of structural equation models in more detail and provide sufficient assumptions under which the set of causal predictors becomes identifiable. We further investigate robustness properties of our approach under model misspecification and discuss possible extensions. The empirical properties are studied for various data sets, including large-scale gene perturbation experiments.},

  abstract = {Several face de-identification methods have been proposed to preserve users' privacy by obscuring their faces. These methods, however, can degrade the quality of photos, and they usually do not preserve the utility of faces, i.e., their age, gender, pose, and facial expression. Recently, advanced generative adversarial network models, such as StyleGAN [ 33], have been proposed, which generate realistic, high-quality imaginary faces. In this paper, we investigate the use of StyleGAN in generating de-identified faces through style mixing, where the styles or features of the target face and an auxiliary face get mixed to generate a de-identified face that carries the utilities of the target face. We examined this de-identification method for preserving utility and privacy by implementing several face detection, verification, and identification attacks and conducting a user study. The results from our extensive experiments, human evaluation, and comparison with two state-of-the-art face de-identification methods, i.e., CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy, show that StyleGAN performs on par or better than these methods, preserving users' privacy and images' utility. In particular, the results of the machine learning-based experiments show that StyleGAN0-4 preserves utility better than CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy while preserving privacy at the same level. StyleGAN 0-3 preserves utility at the same level while providing more privacy. In this paper, for the first time, we also performed a carefully designed user study to examine both privacy and utility-preserving properties of StyleGAN 0-3, 0-4, and 0-5, as well as CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy from the human observers' perspectives. Our statistical tests showed that participants tend to verify and identify StyleGAN 0-5 images easier than DeepPrivacy images. All the methods but StyleGAN 0-5 had significantly lower identification rates than CIAGAN. Regarding utility, as expected, StyleGAN 0-5 performed significantly better in preserving some attributes. Among all methods, on average, participants believe gender has been preserved the most while naturalness has been preserved the least.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Objective: There is increasing pressure to share health information and even make it publicly available. However, such disclosures of personal health information raise serious privacy concerns. To alleviate such concerns, it is possible to anonymize the data before disclosure. One popular anonymization approach is k-anonymity. There have been no evaluations of the actual re-identification probability of k-anonymized data sets.             Design: Through a simulation, we evaluated the re-identification risk of k-anonymization and three different improvements on three large data sets.             Measurement: Re-identification probability is measured under two different re-identification scenarios. Information loss is measured by the commonly used discernability metric.             Results: For one of the re-identification scenarios, k-Anonymity consistently over-anonymizes data sets, with this over-anonymization being most pronounced with small sampling fractions. Over-anonymization results in excessive distortions to the data (i.e., high information loss), making the data less useful for subsequent analysis. We found that a hypothesis testing approach provided the best control over re-identification risk and reduces the extent of information loss compared to baseline k-anonymity.             Conclusion: Guidelines are provided on when to use the hypothesis testing approach instead of baseline k-anonymity.},

Findings               -- The findings support the proposed model. Specifically, high reputation and communication quality increased promotion-focused behaviors and were mediated by trust. In contrast, low communication quality and high data sensitivity increased prevention-focused behaviors and were mediated by privacy concern. Consistent with RFT, higher trust led to promotion-focused behaviors such as willingness to invest in the relationship (e.g., by providing information to the service provider and investing time and energy) and loyalty behaviors. Furthermore, higher privacy concerns led to prevention-focused behaviors such as deflective (e.g., using privacy protection measures such as disguising one's IP address and disabling cookies) and defensive behaviors (e.g., taking action to have one's name removed from mailing lists).

Much of the message-framing literature has focused on the advantages of using either gain or loss frames, depending on the motivational orientation of the target group. In the current study, we extended this research to examine whether a persuasive appeal's effectiveness can be increased by aligning the message framing with the recipient's personality profile. For a single product, we constructed five advertisements, each designed to target one of the five major trait domains of human personality. In a sample of 324 survey respondents, advertisements were evaluated more positively the more they cohered with participants' dispositional motives. These results suggest that adapting persuasive messages to the personality traits of the target audience can be an effective way of increasing the messages' impact, and highlight the potential value of personality-based communication strategies.},

One particular defense allocation algorithm that uses a deceptive signaling scheme is the peSSE (Xu et al., 2015). However, this static signaling scheme optimizes the rate of deception for perfectly rational adversaries and is not personalized to individuals. Here we advance this research by developing a dynamic and personalized signaling scheme using cognitive modeling. A cognitive model based on a theory of experiential-choice (Instance-Based Learning Theory; IBLT), implemented in a cognitive architecture (Adaptive Control of Thought -- Rational; ACT-R), and validated using human experimentation with deceptive signals informs the development of a cognitive signaling scheme. The predictions of the cognitive model show that the proposed solution increases the compliance to deceptive signals beyond the peSSE. These predictions were verified in human experiments, and the results shed additional light on human reactions towards adaptive deceptive signals.},

  abstract = {A recent trend both in academia and industry is to explore the use of deception techniques to achieve proactive attack detection and defense---to the point of marketing intrusion deception solutions as zero-false-positive intrusion detection. However, there is still a general lack of understanding of deception techniques from a research perspective, and it is not clear how the effectiveness of these solutions can be measured and compared with other security approaches. To shed light on this topic, we introduce a comprehensive classification of existing solutions and survey the current application of deception techniques in computer security. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing solutions, and we analyze several open research directions, including the design of strategies to help defenders to design and integrate deception within a target architecture, the study of automated ways to deploy deception in complex systems, the update and re-deployment of deception, and, most importantly, the design of new techniques and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing deception techniques.},

More recently, algorithms have emerged that can also learn causal structure from purely or mostly observational data, as well as experimental data. These methods have started to be applied in various philosophical contexts, such as debates about our concepts of free will and determinism. This paper provides a ``user's guide'' to these methods, though not in the sense of specifying exact button presses in a software package. Instead, we explain the larger ``pipeline'' within which these methods are used and discuss key steps in moving from initial research idea to validated causal structure.},

Traditional, knowledge-based assessments may exclude candidates who are cognitively suited to performing cybersecurity work but who have not had the opportunity to learn the subject matter. Using the job categories included in the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework for the cybersecurity workforce, we propose a model for predicting cybersecurity aptitude beyond a general- intelligence approach. In addition to including general intelligence, the model is based on a classification of jobs as requiring real-time or deliberate performance, and proactive or reactive actions. We suggest that tasks, work roles, and people can be represented along the same set of axes to match job requirements to person attributes. These constructs can then be used to create assessments of potential for cybersecurity applicants, including one we propose, called the Cyber Aptitude and Talent Assessment (CATA).},

  abstract = {The Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), a 30-item self-report measure, is one of the most commonly used scales for the assessment of the personality construct of impulsiveness. It has recently marked 50 years of use in research and clinical settings. The current BIS-11 is held to measure 3 theoretical subtraits, namely, attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsiveness. We evaluated the factor structure of the BIS using full information item bifactor analysis for Likert-type items. We found no evidence supporting the 3-factor model. In fact, half of the items do not share any relation with other items and do not form any factor. In light of this, we introduce a unidimensional Barratt Impulsiveness Scale--Brief (BIS-Brief) that includes 8 of the original BIS-11 items. Next, we present evidence of construct validity comparing scores obtained with the BIS-Brief against the original BIS total scores using data from (a) a community sample of borderline personality patients and normal controls, (b) a forensic sample, and (c) an inpatient sample of young adults and adolescents. We demonstrated similar indices of construct validity that is observed for the BIS-11 total score with the BIS-Brief score. Use of the BIS-Brief in clinical assessment settings and large epidemiological studies of psychiatric disorders will reduce the burden on respondents without loss of information.

Frost and Shows (1993; Behaviour Research and Therapy, 31, 683--692) introduced the Indecisiveness Scale (IS) as a measure of individual differences in general indecisiveness. Although these authors conducted various psychometric analyses, some properties (e.g., factor structure, test-retest reliability) were not investigated. In the present studies, several reliability and validity indices were computed. First, four of the fifteen items of the IS were found to be omissible. Second, 4-week test-retest reliability was found to be satisfactory. Third, scores on the IS were found to correlate meaningfully with a concurrent measure of decision making, and with various scales of psychopathology. Lastly, in Study 4, the IS was found to predict scores on a behavioural measure of decision making, suggesting good predictive validity. Overall, these findings suggest that the IS has good psychometric properties.},

In four experiments we found that an incentive (the opportunity to leave the experiment early) increased problem-solving performance for all problems presented, regardless of problem type. Additionally, we found evidence that the incentive increased recall memory, indicating more thorough processing for participants in the incentive condition.

However, relatively few matrices are in the sets developed by Raven, which limits their use in experiments requiring large numbers of stimuli. For the present study, we analyzed the types of relations that appear in Raven's original Standard Progressive Matrices (SPMs) and created a software tool that can combine the same types of relations according to parameters chosen by the experimenter, to produce very large numbers of matrix problems with specific properties. We then conducted a norming study in which the matrices we generated were compared with the actual SPMs. This study showed that the generated matrices both covered and expanded on the range of problem difficulties provided by the SPMs.},

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to confirm the validity and reliability of data. Regression analysis was used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results supported the proposed hypotheses and showed that extravert investors were more likely to exhibit disposition effect, herding and overconfidence. The conscientiousness trait was associated with disposition effect and overconfidence, while neuroticism was associated with herding behavior. The results confirmed the moderating effect of risk aversion on the association between personality traits, disposition effect, herding and overconfidence. Originality/value This study demonstrates how risk aversion modes the strength of association between psychological characteristics (represented by personality traits) and cognitive biases (disposition effect, herding and overconfidence). The results support the ``auction'' interpretation of investors' behavior by suggesting that personality traits are associated with investment decision-making and that investors are marginal price setters.},

Similarly, it is unclear whether those high in Machiavellianism can recognize bullshit claims and valuable information as such (i.e.,               bullshit sensitivity               ). In this study, we investigated whether different facets of Machiavellianism are prone to the production of different sorts of bullshit and how these facets of Machiavellianism relate to bullshit sensitivity. In a sample of 525 participants (72\% women), we found that the manipulative side of Machiavellianism (               Machiavellian approach               ) was linked to               persuasive bullshitting               , that is, the production of bullshit intended to gain desired resources. Likewise, the distrustful side of Machiavellianism (               Machiavellian avoidance               ) went along with higher               evasive bullshitting               , which means spreading information that ought to prevent individual disadvantages. Next, we found that those high in Machiavellian avoidance, but not Machiavellian approach, were better at differentiating information from bullshit. These links were robust irrespective of different levels of cognitive ability. Ultimately, we discussed future directions for research on bullshitting and disseminating deceptive information in general.},

In particular, the relations between phishing susceptibility and Big Five personality traits have been analyzed via empirical studies in diverse domains. However, little prior work has proposed a mathematical model investigating the effect of an individual's personality traits on perceived trust or risk and decision performance. This work proposes a probability model using Stochastic Petri Nets in order to examine the effect of an individual human's personality traits on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance. Our results show that agreeableness and neuroticism have significant effect on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance particularly when openness and conscientiousness is very low. The developed mathematical model can be applied to predict what personality profiles in an organization are more exposed to social engineering, suggesting customized security training scenarios.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between personality factors, problem solving ability and medical errors. Material and methods This study was a questionnaire case control study. Information on 49 members of medical and nursing staff with medical errors (case group) and 46 without medical errors (control group) were analyzed. To collect the data, two Heppner problem solving questionnaires and the NEO-Five Factor Inventory were used, which were completed by the study population. Results The results illustrate that individuals without medical errors showed higher scores in contentiousness, extraversion and agreeableness and lower scores in neuroticism than those with medical errors. Individuals without medical errors also showed higher scores in problem solving ability scales than those with medical errors. Conclusion Results of this study, suggest that personality factors and problem solving ability are related to medical errors and it may be possible for hospital authorities to use this knowledge when selecting capable medical staff.},

CSE and CPI were associated with all five personality dimensions: positively with Openness to Experience, Extraversion and Conscientiousness, negatively with Neuroticism and Agreeableness. The separate analyses conducted on men and women showed the differences among the predictors of CSE and CPI. Although Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism predicted CSE among both men and women, Extraversion was positively and Agreeableness negatively related to women's CSE. Conscientiousness was positively related to CPI only among men, and Agreeableness was negatively related to it only among women. Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness predicted CPI in the same manner among men and women.},

In Experiment 1, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed an interaction between neuroticism and pressure condition. Neuroticism negatively predicted performance under social pressure, but did not affect decision-making under low pressure. Additionally, the negative effect of neuroticism under pressure was replicated using a combined social and time pressure manipulation in Experiment 2. These results support distraction theory whereby pressure taxes highly neurotic individuals' cognitive resources, leading to sub-optimal performance. Agreeableness also negatively predicted performance in both experiments.},

As predicted, Openness to Experience was modestly but significantly related to both SAI (r=.20) and Gf (r=.21). SAI was also significantly correlated (negatively, r=-.21) with Neuroticism. Regressing the Big Five personality traits onto SAI scores, showed that these personality traits were found to account for between 9\% and 16\% of the variance in SAI. At the same time, SAI (and Openness) was a significant correlate and predictor of Gf, which suggests that SAI may be a mediating concept between personality and psychometric intelligence.

It provides the first meta-analysis of personality and intelligence to comprehensively examine (a) facet-level correlations for these hierarchical frameworks of personality, (b) item-level correlations, (c) domain- and facet-level predictive models. Age and sex differences in personality and intelligence, and study-level moderators, are also examined. The study was complemented by four of our own unpublished data sets (N = 26,813) which were used to assess the ability of item-level models to provide generalizable prediction. Results showed that openness ({$\rho$} = .20) and neuroticism ({$\rho$} = -.09) were the strongest Big Five correlates of intelligence and that openness correlated more with crystallized than fluid intelligence. At the facet level, traits related to intellectual engagement and unconventionality were more strongly related to intelligence than other openness facets, and sociability and orderliness were negatively correlated with intelligence. Facets of gregariousness and excitement seeking had stronger negative correlations, and openness to aesthetics, feelings, and values had stronger positive correlations with crystallized than fluid intelligence. Facets explained more than twice the variance of domains. Overall, the results provide the most nuanced and robust evidence to date of the relationship between personality and intelligence.

Using a dataset of over 300K posts by {$\sim$}39K individuals on an online community TalkLife, we present a study to investigate the effect of several factors, such as adaptability, diversity, immediacy, and the nature of support. Unlike typical causal studies that focus on the effect of each treatment, we focus on the outcome and address the reverse causal question of identifying treatments that may have led to the outcome, drawing on case-control studies in epidemiology. Specifically, we define the outcome as an aggregate of affective, behavioral, and cognitive psychosocial change and identify Case (most improved) and Control (least improved) cohorts of individuals. Considering responses from peers as treatments, we evaluate the differences in the responses received by Case and Control, per matched clusters of similar individuals. We find that effective support includes complex language factors such as diversity, adaptability, and style, but simple indicators such as quantity and immediacy are not causally relevant. Our work bears methodological and design implications for online mental health platforms, and has the potential to guide suggestive interventions for peer supporters on these platforms.},

  abstract = {The growing use of social media among Internet users produces a vast and new source of user generated ecological data, such as textual posts and images, which can be collected for research purposes. The increasing convergence between social and computer sciences has led researchers to develop automated methods to extract and analyze these digital footprints to predict personality traits. These social media-based predictions can then be used for a variety of purposes, including tailoring online services to improve user experience, enhance recommender systems, and as a possible screening and implementation tool for public health. In this paper, we conduct a series of meta-analyses to determine the predictive power of digital footprints collected from social media over Big 5 personality traits. Further, we investigate the impact of different types of digital footprints on prediction accuracy. Results of analyses show that the predictive power of digital footprints over personality traits is in line with the standard ``correlational upper-limit'' for behavior to predict personality, with correlations ranging from 0.29 (Agreeableness) to 0.40 (Extraversion). Overall, our findings indicate that accuracy of predictions is consistent across Big 5 traits, and that accuracy improves when analyses include demographics and multiple types of digital footprints.},

In this study we tried to infer personality traits from the way users take pictures and apply filters to them. To investigate this relationship, we conducted an online survey where we asked participants to fill in a personality questionnaire, and grant us access to their Instagram account through the Instagram API. Among 113 participants and 22,398 extracted Instagram pictures, we found distinct picture features (e.g., hue, brightness, saturation) that are related to personality traits. Our findings suggest a relationship between personality traits and the way users want to make their pictures look. This allow for new ways to extract personality traits from social media trails, and new ways to facilitate personalized systems.},

Study 1 examined the associations between pathological personality traits and self-reported aspects of emotion dysregulation among 932 undergraduates. The results of Study 1 revealed associations between pathological personality traits and specific aspects of emotion dysregulation (e.g., antagonism was associated with impulse control difficulties and limited access to emotion regulation strategies). Study 2 was an experience-sampling study that explored the relationship between pathological personality traits and emotional reactivity to daily events for 350 undergraduates over the course of seven days. Key results from Study 2 showed that negative affectivity, detachment, and antagonism moderated individuals' reactions to daily negative interpersonal events. The results of these studies suggest important connections between pathological personality traits and emotion regulation difficulties that may shed light on the interpersonal problems that often accompany personality pathology.},

Along with baseline signals from the resting period, EEG was measured while subjects viewed pictures of three types of emotional stimuli (negatively arousing, calm, and positively arousing) chosen from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). A major question raised by the brain's response to emotional stimuli was whether these changes were related to preexistent differences in subjects' mood state and personality. Extraverted subjects and those with normal mood disturbance scores showed a greater response to positive stimuli processing while brain areas of introverted subjects and those with high mood disturbance scores were highly responsive to negative emotional pictures in the upper alpha frequency bands (10{\textasciitilde}12 Hz).},

Yet, state-of-the-art methods build upon simple long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, thus rendering inferences for complex, long-range dependencies challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel Causal Transformer for estimating counterfactual outcomes over time. Our model is specifically designed to capture complex, long-range dependencies among time-varying confounders. For this, we combine three transformer subnetworks with separate inputs for time-varying covariates, previous treatments, and previous outcomes into a joint network with in-between cross-attentions. We further develop a custom, end-to-end training procedure for our Causal Transformer. Specifically, we propose a novel counterfactual domain confusion loss to address confounding bias: it aims to learn adversarial balanced representations, so that they are predictive of the next outcome but non-predictive of the current treatment assignment. We evaluate our Causal Transformer based on synthetic and real-world datasets, where it achieves superior performance over current baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing transformer-based architecture for estimating counterfactual outcomes from longitudinal data.}

Using propensity score stratification to reduce bias from confounding factors, we analyze the Twitter data of 63k college students over 5 years to study the effect of early alcohol usage on topics linked to college success.  We find multi-year effects, including lower mentions of study habits, increased mentions of potentially risky behaviors, and decreases in mentions of positive emotions.

  abstract = {Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data is a central problem in many domains. Because counterfactual data is inaccessible, the problem differs fundamentally from supervised learning, and entails a more complex set of modeling choices. Despite a variety of recently proposed algorithmic solutions, a principled guideline for building estimators of treatment effects using machine learning algorithms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide such a guideline by characterizing the fundamental limits of estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, and establishing conditions under which these limits can be achieved. Our analysis reveals that the relative importance of the different aspects of observational data vary with the sample size. For instance, we show that selection bias matters only in small-sample regimes, whereas with a large sample size, the way an algorithm models the control and treated outcomes is what bottlenecks its performance. Guided by our analysis, we build a practical algorithm for estimating treatment effects using a non-stationary Gaussian processes with doubly-robust hyperparameters. Using a standard semi-synthetic simulation setup, we show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art, and that the behavior of existing algorithms conforms with our analysis.}

Such approaches can provide advantages to defenders by delaying attacker forward progress and thereby decreasing or eliminating attacker payoffs. In this work, we expand previous work by incorporating new parameters relating to attacker costs and choices. The extended model includes attacker costs for probing a system to learn its declared type (``real'' or ``fake'') and allows an attacker to proactively choose to leave the game early by walking away. While these additional parameters represent extensions to our prior model, they are key to understanding attacker behavior when confronted with deceptive cyber defenses. We first present the extended model and an analysis of the expected rewards for rational players. We then present the behavior of an adaptive attacker in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) simulation. Lastly, we relate our analytic and empirical findings to cognitive bias effects and speculate on how the manipulation of game parameters may be used in future work to both estimate and trigger bias effects during defender-attacker interactions.},

Consistent with some previous studies, we found significant correlations among some of the Dark Triad variables and between each of the Dark Triad variables and some of the Big 5.

At the univariate level, all traits showed the influence of genetic and non-shared environmental factors, with heritabilities ranging between .31 and .72; Machiavellianism alone also showed the influence of shared environmental factors.},

The study examines the sensitivity of the measures to these three aspects analytically and empirically by means of simulations. Even if some distance measures underperform, the study shows that there is no universally optimal distance index, and that the choice of a measure depends on which aspect we want to focus on. From the review and simulation results, the paper derives guidelines to help the end user to choose the right dissimilarity measure for her or his research objectives.

In this review and perspective article, we introduce the concept of causality in the context of cognitive neuroscience and review existing methods for inferring causal relationships from data. Causal inference is an ambitious task that is particularly challenging in cognitive neuroscience. We discuss two difficulties in more detail: the scarcity of interventional data and the challenge of finding the right variables. We argue for distributional robustness as a guiding principle to tackle these problems. Robustness (or invariance) is a fundamental principle underlying causal methodology. A (correctly specified) causal model of a target variable generalizes across environments or subjects as long as these environments leave the causal mechanisms of the target intact. Consequently, if a candidate model does not generalize, then either it does not consist of the target variable's causes or the underlying variables do not represent the correct granularity of the problem. In this sense, assessing generalizability may be useful when defining relevant variables and can be used to partially compensate for the lack of interventional data.},

In an attribute inference attack, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training records and access to a model trained on those records, and infers the unknown values of a sensitive feature of those records. We study a fine-grained variant of attribute inference we call sensitive value inference, where the adversary's goal is to identify with high confidence some records from a candidate set where the unknown attribute has a particular sensitive value. We explicitly compare attribute inference with data imputation that captures the training distribution statistics, under various assumptions about the training data available to the adversary. Our main conclusions are: (1) previous attribute inference methods do not reveal more about the training data from the model than can be inferred by an adversary without access to the trained model, but with the same knowledge of the underlying distribution as needed to train the attribute inference attack; (2) black-box attribute inference attacks rarely learn anything that cannot be learned without the model; but (3) white-box attacks, which we introduce and evaluate in the paper, can reliably identify some records with the sensitive value attribute that would not be predicted without having access to the model. Furthermore, we show that proposed defenses such as differentially private training and removing vulnerable records from training do not mitigate this privacy risk.

Separate feature sets are typically used for different prediction tasks, e.g., student activity logs for predicting in-course performance and registrar data for predicting long-term college success. However, little is known about the overall utility of different data sources across prediction tasks and the fairness of their predictions with respect to different subpopulations. Using data from over 2,000 college students at a large public university, we examined the utility of institutional data, learning management system (LMS) data, and survey data for accurately and fairly predicting short-term and long-term student success. We found that institutional data and LMS data both have decent predictive power, but survey data shows very little predictive utility. Combining institutional data with LMS data leads to even higher accuracy than using either alone. In terms of fairness, using institutional data consistently underestimates historically disadvantaged student subpopulations more than their peers, whereas LMS data tend to overestimate some of these groups more often. Combining the two data sources does not fully neutralize the biases and still leads to high rates of underestimation among disadvantaged groups. Moreover, algorithmic biases affect not only demographic minorities but also students with acquired disadvantages. These analyses serve to inform more cost-effective and equitable use of student data for predictive analytics applications in higher education. [For the full proceedings, see ED607784.]},

  abstract = {The field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last decade, several formal, mathematical definitions of fairness have gained prominence. Here we first assemble and categorize these definitions into two broad families: (1) those that constrain the effects of decisions on disparities; and (2) those that constrain the effects of legally protected characteristics, like race and gender, on decisions. We then show, analytically and empirically, that both families of definitions typically result in strongly Pareto dominated decision policies. For example, in the case of college admissions, adhering to popular formal conceptions of fairness would simultaneously result in lower student-body diversity and a less academically prepared class, relative to what one could achieve by explicitly tailoring admissions policies to achieve desired outcomes. In this sense, requiring that these fairness definitions hold can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect. In contrast to axiomatic notions of fairness, we argue that the equitable design of algorithms requires grappling with their context-specific consequences, akin to the equitable design of policy. We conclude by listing several open challenges in fair machine learning and offering strategies to ensure algorithms are better aligned with policy goals.},

A concern is that students opting out of learning analytics may skew predictive models, in particular if certain student populations disproportionately opt out and biases are unintentionally introduced into predictive models. We investigated university students' propensity to consent to learning analytics through an email prompt, and collected respondents' perceived benefits and privacy concerns regarding learning analytics in a subsequent online survey. In particular, we studied whether and why students' consent propensity differs among student subpopulations bysending our email prompt to a sample of 4,000 students at our institution stratified by ethnicity and gender. 272 students interacted with the email, of which 119 also completed the survey. We identified that institutional trust, concerns with the amount of data collection versus perceived benefits, and comfort with instructors' data use for learning engagement were key determinants in students' decision to participate in learning analytics. We find that students identifying ethnically as Black were significantly less likely to respond and self-reported lower levels of institutional trust. Female students reported concerns with data collection but were also more comfortable with use of their data by instructors for learning engagement purposes. Students' comments corroborate these findings and suggest that agency alone is insufficient; institutional leaders and instructors also play a large role in alleviating the issue of bias.},

Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly adopted to support various activities in education, including being applied in important contexts such as college admission and scholarship allocation. In addition to being accurate, the application of these techniques has to be fair, i.e., displaying no discrimination towards any group of stakeholders in education (mainly students and instructors) based on their protective attributes (e.g., gender and age). The past few years have witnessed an explosion of attention given to the predictive bias of ML techniques in education. Though certain endeavors have been made to detect and alleviate predictive bias in learning analytics, it is still hard for newcomers to penetrate. To address this, we systematically reviewed existing studies on predictive bias in education, and a total of 49 peer-reviewed empirical papers published after 2010 were included in this study. In particular, these papers were reviewed and summarized from the following three perspectives: (i) protective attributes, (ii) fairness measures and their applications in various educational tasks, and (iii) strategies for enhancing predictive fairness. These findings were summarized into recommendations to guide future endeavors in this strand of research, e.g., collecting and sharing more quality data containing protective attributes, developing fairness-enhancing approaches which do not require the explicit use of protective attributes, validating the effectiveness of fairness-enhancing on students and instructors in real-world settings.},

Specifically, we show that the recent notion of differential privacv, in addition to its own intrinsic virtue, can ensure that participants have limited effect on the outcome of the mechanism, and as a consequence have limited incentive to lie. More precisely, mechanisms with differential privacy are approximate dominant strategy under arbitrary player utility functions, are automatically resilient to coalitions, and easily allow repeatability. We study several special cases of the unlimited supply auction problem, providing new results for digital goods auctions, attribute auctions, and auctions with arbitrary structural constraints on the prices. As an important prelude to developing a privacy-preserving auction mechanism, we introduce and study a generalization of previous privacy work that accommodates the high sensitivity of the auction setting, where a single participant may dramatically alter the optimal fixed price, and a slight change in the offered price may take the revenue from optimal to zero.},

Our work addresses this need by studying the predictability of user demographics based on the list of a user's apps which is readily available to many app developers. We extend previous work on the problem on three frontiers: (1) We predict new demographics (age, race, and income) and analyze the most informative apps for four demographic attributes included in our analysis. The most predictable attribute is gender (82.3 \% accuracy), whereas the hardest to predict is income (60.3 \% accuracy). (2) We compare several dimensionality reduction methods for high-dimensional app data, finding out that an unsupervised method yields superior results compared to aggregating the apps at the app category level, but the best results are obtained simply by the raw list of apps. (3) We look into the effect of the training set size and the number of apps on the predictability and show that both of these factors have a large impact on the prediction accuracy. The predictability increases, or in other words, a user's privacy decreases, the more apps the user has used, but somewhat surprisingly, after 100 apps, the prediction accuracy starts to decrease.},

However, concerns exist about the accuracy of ChatGPT responses and the references used to generate medical content., Methods, This observational study investigated the authenticity and accuracy of references in medical articles generated by ChatGPT. ChatGPT-3.5 generated 30 short medical papers, each with at least three references, based on standardized prompts encompassing various topics and therapeutic areas. Reference authenticity and accuracy were verified by searching Medline, Google Scholar, and the Directory of Open Access Journals. The authenticity and accuracy of~individual ChatGPT-generated reference elements were also determined., Results, Overall, 115 references were generated by ChatGPT, with a mean of 3.8{\textpm}1.1 per paper. Among these references, 47\% were fabricated, 46\% were authentic but inaccurate, and only 7\% were authentic and accurate. The likelihood of fabricated references significantly differed based on prompt variations; yet the frequency of authentic and accurate references remained low in all cases.~Among the seven components evaluated for each reference, an incorrect PMID number was most common, listed in 93\% of papers. Incorrect volume (64\%), page numbers (64\%), and year of publication (60\%) were the next most frequent errors. The mean number of inaccurate components was 4.3{\textpm}2.8 out of seven per reference., Conclusions, The findings of this study emphasize the need for caution when seeking medical information on ChatGPT since most of the references provided were found to be fabricated or inaccurate. Individuals are advised to verify medical information from reliable sources and avoid relying solely on artificial intelligence-generated content.},

  abstract = {A great deal of empirical research has examined who falls for misinformation and why. Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with news stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information consumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns of engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is because producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that lead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true ones---even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information. We then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In three studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they perceive as more accurate---both in a general population sample, and in a sample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to misinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news---and consistent with the predictions of our model---we find markedly different engagement patterns for articles from misinformation versus mainstream news sites. Using 1,000 headlines from 20 misinformation and 20 mainstream news sites, we compare Facebook engagement data with 20,000 accuracy ratings collected in a survey experiment. Engagement with a headline is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy for misinformation sites, but positively correlated with perceived accuracy for mainstream sites. Taken together, these theoretical and empirical results suggest that consumer preferences cannot be straightforwardly inferred from empirical patterns of engagement.},

This review aims to see why fake news is widely shared on social media and why some people believe it. The presentation of its structure (from the images chosen, the format of the titles and the language used in the text) can explain the reasons for going viral and what factors are associated with the belief in fake news. We show that fake news explores all possible aspects to attract the reader's attention, from the formation of the title to the language used throughout the body of the text. The proliferation and success of fake news are associated with its characteristics (more surreal, exaggerated, impressive, emotional, persuasive, clickbait, shocking images), which seem to be strategically thought out and exploited by the creators of fake news. This review shows that fake news continues to be widely shared and consumed because that is the main objective of its creators. Although some studies do not support these correlations, it appears that conservatives, right-wing people, the elderly and less educated people are more likely to believe and spread fake news.},

However, algorithmic bias has the potential to reinforce racial inequities in postsecondary success. We provide a comprehensive and translational investigation of algorithmic bias in two separate prediction models---one predicting course completion, the second predicting degree completion. We show that if either model were used to target additional supports for ``at-risk'' students, then the algorithmic bias would lead to fewer marginal Black students receiving these resources. We also find the magnitude of algorithmic bias varies within the distribution of predicted success. With the degree completion model, the amount of bias is over 5 times higher when we define at-risk using the bottom               decile               than when we focus on students in the bottom               half               of predicted scores; in the course completion model, the reverse is true. These divergent patterns emphasize the contextual nature of algorithmic bias and attempts to mitigate it. Our results moreover suggest that algorithmic bias is due in part to currently-available administrative data being relatively less useful at predicting Black student success, particularly for new students; this suggests that additional data collection efforts have the potential to mitigate bias.},

  abstract = {An increased awareness concerning risks of algorithmic bias has driven a surge of efforts around bias mitigation strategies. A vast majority of the proposed approaches fall under one of two categories: (1) imposing algorithmic fairness constraints on predictive models, and (2) collecting additional training samples. Most recently and at the intersection of these two categories, methods that propose active learning under fairness constraints have been developed. However, proposed bias mitigation strategies typically overlook the bias presented in the observed labels. In this work, we study fairness considerations of active data collection strategies in the presence of label bias. We first present an overview of different types of label bias in the context of supervised learning systems. We then empirically show that, when overlooking label bias, collecting more data can aggravate bias, and imposing fairness constraints that rely on the observed labels in the data collection process may not address the problem. Our results illustrate the unintended consequences of deploying a model that attempts to mitigate a single type of bias while neglecting others, emphasizing the importance of explicitly differentiating between the types of bias that fairness-aware algorithms aim to address, and highlighting the risks of neglecting label bias during data collection.},

  abstract = {Racial bias in health algorithms                            The U.S. health care system uses commercial algorithms to guide health decisions. Obermeyer               et al.               find evidence of racial bias in one widely used algorithm, such that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than White patients (see the Perspective by Benjamin). The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Bias occurs because the algorithm uses health costs as a proxy for health needs. Less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Reformulating the algorithm so that it no longer uses costs as a proxy for needs eliminates the racial bias in predicting who needs extra care.                                         Science               , this issue p.               447               ; see also p.               421                        ,              A health algorithm that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs leads to racial bias against Black patients.           ,              Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},

  abstract = {As machine learning (ML) becomes more prevalent in human-centric applications, there is a growing emphasis on algorithmic fairness and privacy protection. While previous research has explored these areas as separate objectives, there is a growing recognition of the complex relationship between privacy and fairness. However, previous works have primarily focused on examining the interplay between privacy and fairness through empirical investigations, with limited attention given to theoretical exploration. This study aims to bridge this gap by introducing a theoretical framework that enables a comprehensive examination of their interrelation. We shall develop and analyze an information bottleneck (IB) based information obfuscation method with local differential privacy (LDP) for fair representation learning. In contrast to many empirical studies on fairness in ML, we show that the incorporation of LDP randomizers during the encoding process can enhance the fairness of the learned representation. Our analysis will demonstrate that the disclosure of sensitive information is constrained by the privacy budget of the LDP randomizer, thereby enabling the optimization process within the IB framework to effectively suppress sensitive information while preserving the desired utility through obfuscation. Based on the proposed method, we further develop a variational representation encoding approach that simultaneously achieves fairness and LDP. Our variational encoding approach offers practical advantages. It is trained using a non-adversarial method and does not require the introduction of any variational prior. Extensive experiments will be presented to validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the ability of our proposed approach to achieve both LDP and fairness while preserving adequate utility.},

These issues underscore the need for new directions in fairness research that take into account a multiplicity of considerations, from privacy preservation, context sensitivity and process fairness, to an awareness of sociotechnical impact and the increasingly important role of inclusive and participatory research processes. Most current approaches for algorithmic fairness assume that the target characteristics for fairness---frequently, race and legal gender---can be observed or recorded. Sexual orientation and gender identity are prototypical instances of unobserved characteristics, which are frequently missing, unknown or fundamentally unmeasurable. This paper highlights the importance of developing new approaches for algorithmic fairness that break away from the prevailing assumption of observed characteristics.},

Through this paper, we consider calls to collect more data on demographics to enable algorithmic fairness and challenge the notion that discrimination can be overcome with smart enough technical methods and sufficient data. We show how these techniques largely ignore broader questions of data governance and systemic oppression when categorizing individuals for the purpose of fairer algorithmic processing. In this work, we explore under what conditions demographic data should be collected and used to enable algorithmic fairness methods by characterizing a range of social risks to individuals and communities. For the risks to individuals we consider the unique privacy risks of sensitive attributes, the possible harms of miscategorization and misrepresentation, and the use of sensitive data beyond data subjects' expectations. Looking more broadly, the risks to entire groups and communities include the expansion of surveillance infrastructure in the name of fairness, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing what it means to be part of a demographic group, and ceding the ability to define what constitutes biased or unfair treatment. We argue that, by confronting these questions before and during the collection of demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually mitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of oppression. Towards this end, we assess privacy-focused methods of data collection and use and participatory data governance structures as proposals for more responsibly collecting demographic data.},

To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analysed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted, why they are deemed important, what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies.},

Most approaches to understanding or improving the fairness of these systems have focused on static settings without considering long-term dynamics. This is understandable; long term dynamics are hard to assess, particularly because they do not align with the traditional supervised ML research framework that uses fixed data sets. To address this structural difficulty in the field, we advocate for the use of simulation as a key tool in studying the fairness of algorithms. We explore three toy examples of dynamical systems that have been previously studied in the context of fair decision making for bank loans, college admissions, and allocation of attention. By analyzing how learning agents interact with these systems in simulation, we are able to extend previous work, showing that static or single-step analyses do not give a complete picture of the long-term consequences of an ML-based decision system. We provide an extensible open-source software framework for implementing fairness-focused simulation studies and further reproducible research, available at https://github.com/google/ml-fairness-gym.},

Bedrock concepts in computer science---such as abstraction and modular design---are used to define notions of fairness and discrimination, to produce fairness-aware learning algorithms, and to intervene at different stages of a decision-making pipeline to produce "fair" outcomes. In this paper, however, we contend that these concepts render technical interventions ineffective, inaccurate, and sometimes dangerously misguided when they enter the societal context that surrounds decision-making systems. We outline this mismatch with five "traps" that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.},

Done under the banner of ``learning analytics,'' this work can---and often does---surface sensitive data and information about, inter alia, a student's demographics, academic performance, offline and online movements, physical fitness, mental wellbeing, and social network. With these data, institutions and third parties are able to describe student life, predict future behaviors, and intervene to address academic or other barriers to student success (however defined). Learning analytics, consequently, raise serious issues concerning student privacy, autonomy, and the appropriate flow of student data. We argue that issues around privacy lead to valid questions about the degree to which students should trust their institution to use learning analytics data and other artifacts (algorithms, predictive scores) with their interests in mind. We argue that higher education institutions are paradigms of information fiduciaries. As such, colleges and universities have a special responsibility to their students. In this article, we use the information fiduciary concept to analyze cases when learning analytics violate an institution's responsibility to its students.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in big data have heightened the need for data governance in any organization. There has been a growing interest and recognition of the importance of data governance in higher education. While multiple research efforts focus on a literature-based approach to conceptualize data governance, evidence-based research on this topic can scarcely be found. Higher education institutes are facing similar challenges in aligning their information technology (IT) efforts with business processes to meet organizational goals. This study aims to address such a research gap and investigates the status quo of data governance practice across tier one universities in the United States. Using Web content analysis, this paper sought to obtain empirical evidence of data governance initiatives, the extent of data governance, and its relationship with IT governance and information governance across a sample of 30 tier one university websites. Results of this study revealed that most of the universities created a new data governance unit with different labels (e.g., data governance, institutional research, or data management/analytics), while some universities extended IT governance or information governance to data governance. These findings shed light on the potential directions of developing data governance initiatives in higher education.},

There are several strategies that can be applied to protect IDP, but little is known regarding how social media users perceive IDP threats or how they prefer to respond to them. We utilized a mixed-method approach with a replication study to examine user beliefs about various government-, platform-, and user-level strategies for managing IDP violations. Participants reported that IDP represented a 'serious' online threat, and identified themselves as primarily responsible for responding to violations. IDP strategies that felt more familiar and provided greater perceived control over violations (e.g., flagging, blocking, unfriending) were rated as more effective than platform or government driven interventions. Furthermore, we found users were more willing to share on social media if they perceived their interactions as protected. Findings are discussed in relation to control paradox theory.},

A survey was administered to 250 social media-savvy respondents to investigate their attitudes about saving, sharing, publishing, and removing online photos; the survey also explored participants' current photo-sharing and reuse practices, and their general expectations of photo reuse. Our probe of respondent attitudes revealed that respondents felt: (1) people should be able to save visual media, regardless of its source; (2) people have slightly less right to reuse photos than they do to save them; (3) a photo's subject has a slightly greater right than the photographer to reuse the photo in non-commercial situations; (4) removal is controversial, but trends more positive when it involves only metadata (e.g. tags); and (5) access to institutional archives of personal photos is better deferred for 50 years. Participants explained their own reuse of online photos in pragmatic terms that included the nature of the content, the aim and circumstances of reuse, their sense of the photo's original use, and their understanding of existing laws and restrictions. In the abstract, the same general question revealed a 'reuse paradox'; while respondents trust themselves to make this judgment, they do not trust the reciprocal judgment of unknown others.},

Here, a person's own information privacy is affected by the decisions of others -- a phenomenon referred to as interdependent privacy. Building on the 3R Interdependent Privacy Protection Framework, we explore the underlying mechanisms of how and why interdependent privacy violations happen and how they can be remedied. Drawing on an online vignette experiment (N\,=\,330), we investigate the efficacy of an interdependent privacy salience nudge and reveal that it can decrease the likelihood that users disclose others' personal information by 62\%. Furthermore, we develop a novel measurement instrument and empirically validate that users' decision to disclose others' personal information to an online platform is formed via a serial mediation mechanism through users' realization of the data transfer, recognition of others' ownership, and respect for others' rights. We discuss important implications for both theory and practice.},

However, individuals' expressions of concern about exposure of their personal information are generally not matched by their behavioural caution. One reason for this mismatch could be the varied and intangible value of personal data. We present three studies investigating the potential association between personal data value and privacy behaviour, assessing both individual and cross-cultural differences in personal data valuation, comparing collectivist and individualistic cultures. Study 1a, using a representative UK sample, found no relationship between personal data value and privacy behaviour. However, Study 1b found Indian (collectivist) participants' privacy behaviour was sensitive to personal data value, unlike US (individualist) participants. Study 2 showed that in a UK sample, privacy behaviour was sensitive to personal data value but only for individuals who think of themselves as more similar to others (i.e., self-construe as similar, rather than different). We suggest those who prioritise group memberships are more sensitive to unintentional disclosure harm and therefore behave in accordance with personal data valuations---which informs the privacy concern-behaviour relationship. Our findings can suggest approaches to encourage privacy behaviours.},

In sharing content, users often have to make access control or privacy decisions that impact other stakeholders or co-owners. These decisions involve negotiation, either implicitly or explicitly. Over time, as users engage in these interactions, their own privacy attitudes evolve, influenced by and consequently influencing their peers. In this paper, we present a variation of the one-shot Ultimatum Game, wherein we model individual users interacting with their peers to make privacy decisions about shared content. We analyze the effects of sharing dynamics on individuals' privacy preferences over repeated interactions of the game. We theoretically demonstrate conditions under which users' access decisions eventually converge, and characterize this limit as a function of inherent individual preferences at the start of the game and willingness to concede these preferences over time. We provide simulations highlighting specific insights on global and local influence, short-term interactions and the effects of homophily on consensus.},

We conducted a qualitative interview study of young adults (N=23), and extend research on collective boundary regulation by studying sanctions in the context of popular SNS. Through a systematization of sanctioning strategies, we find that young adults prefer to use indirect and invisible sanctions to preserve strong-tie relationships. Such sanctions are not always effective in helping the violator understand the nature of their normative violation. We offer suggestions on supporting online sanctioning that make norms more visible and signal violations in ways that avoid direct confrontation to reduce the risk of harming on-going social relationships.},

However, prior research has focused almost exclusively on how consumers make decisions about their own data. In this research, we explore how consumers' social value orientation impacts their decisions regarding data about others. In contrast to the notion of proselfs as ``selfish'' decision-makers, across four studies we find that proselfs are less likely than prosocials to share data about others with third parties. We show that this effect arises because proselfs feel less ownership over data they hold about others than prosocials, which in turn reduces their willingness to share it. Overall, this work contributes to literature on social value orientation as well as privacy decision-making and helps marketers and policy makers in designing interdependent privacy choice contexts.},

The historical dynamic of politics in this policy area has been to expand the rights of owners while circumscribing the public realm of information and knowledge. In recent decades the public domain has become merely a residual, all that is left when all other rights (as constructed by IPRs) have been exercised. The advent of digital rights management (DRM) technologies has disturbed a reasonably legitimate politico-legal settlement over "fair use," challenging the existing balance between the rights of "creators" and the interests of users. The breakdown of the norms underpinning IPRs has prompted renewed debate regarding their legitimacy. Although it is technological change that has enhanced not only the ability to copy but also the potential to control the distribution of content, this paper suggests that this argument will not be won or lost in the realm of technology. Rather, new technologies return the question of the control of knowledge and information (content) to the realm of politics.},

However, social-media platforms do not proactively protect users from the occurrence of MPCs. Hence, users resort to out-of-band, informal communication channels, attempting to mitigate such conflicts. So far, previous works have focused on hard interventions that do not adequately consider the contextual factors (e.g., social norms, cognitive priming) or are employed too late (i.e., the content has already been seen). In this work, we investigate the potential of conversational agents as a medium for negotiating and mitigating MPCs. We designed MediationBot, a mediator chatbot that encourages consent collection, enables users to explain their points of view, and proposes solutions to finding a middle ground. We evaluated our design using a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with N = 32 participants, where we found that MediationBot can effectively help participants to reach an agreement and to prevent MPCs. It produced a structured conversation where participants had well-clarified speaking turns. Overall, our participants found MediationBot to be supportive as it proposes useful middle-ground solutions. Our work informs the future design of mediator agents to support social-media users against MPCs.},

Previous works uncovered coping strategies by co-owners to manage their privacy, but mainly focused on general practices and experiences. We establish an empirical base for the prevalence, context and severity of privacy conflicts over co-owned photos. To this aim, a parallel survey of pre-screened 496 uploaders and 537 co-owners collected occurrences and type of conflicts over co-owned photos, and any actions taken towards resolving them. We uncover nuances and complexities not known before, including co-ownership types, and divergences in the assessment of photo audiences. We also find that an all-or-nothing approach seems to dominate conflict resolution, even when parties actually interact and talk about the conflict. Finally, we derive key insights for designing systems to mitigate these divergences and facilitate consensus.},

  abstract = {Fundamental to Augmented Reality (AR) headsets is their capacity to visually and aurally sense the world around them, necessary to drive the positional tracking that makes rendering 3D spatial content possible. This requisite sensing also opens the door for more advanced AR-driven activities, such as augmented perception, volumetric capture and biometric identification - activities with the potential to expose bystanders to significant privacy risks. Existing Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) often safeguard against these risks at a low level e.g., instituting camera access controls. However, we argue that such PETs are incompatible with the need for always-on sensing given AR headsets' intended everyday use. Through an online survey (N=102), we examine bystanders' awareness of, and concerns regarding, potentially privacy infringing AR activities; the extent to which bystanders' consent should be sought; and the level of granularity of information necessary to provide awareness of AR activities to bystanders. Our findings suggest that PETs should take into account the AR activity type, and relationship to bystanders, selectively facilitating awareness and consent. In this way, we can ensure bystanders feel their privacy is respected by everyday AR headsets, and avoid unnecessary rejection of these powerful devices by society.},

We present the results of a 14-day in-situ study designed to understand peoples' sentiments about sensing capabilities in smart campuses and how they would specify privacy preferences. In contrast to prior work, which reported the importance of sensing modality and purpose, our findings indicate that indoor location type and recipient are primary determinants for comfort, surprise, notification preferences, and allowance of data collection. Further, we observed that indoor location type influences privacy control willingness and how users specify sensor controlling rule. For example, our participants allowed policy-controlled data collection in group areas while denying it in learning areas. Finally, we suggest that academic environments are unique, possibly due to the complex relationships between students, staff, and faculty.},

To understand this policy's impact, we investigated 100 top-ranked US universities' directory information sharing practices, finding they publish student contact information online, and provide PII offline by request to many parties, including data brokers. Universities provide limited opt out choices, and focus on negative effects when advising students about opting out. Lastly, we evaluate student preferences regarding the identified directory practices through a survey of 991 US university students. Based on these results, we provide recommendations to align directory practices with student privacy preferences.},

In Experiment 2, 44 children age 4--5 were asked what a person was allowed to do with a natural object that belonged to the person, belonged to someone else, or belonged to no one. Children were permitted to provide as many responses as they wished. Children's responses reflected an appreciation that ownership affects a wide range of object uses, including harmless object use. Children's responses also reflected an appreciation that owner's rights should be upheld regardless of whether the owner's identity is known, or whether the owner is nearby. Moreover, children's responses suggest that they view ownership as restricting nonowners from using property, rather than affecting use by entitling owners.

We investigated whether preschool children and adults believe that ownership of one person's property is transferred to a second person following the second person's investment of creative labor in that property. In our study, an experimenter and a participant borrowed modeling-clay objects from each other to mold into new objects. Participants were more likely to transfer ownership to the second individual after he or she invested creative labor in the object than after any other manipulations (holding the object, making small changes to it). This effect was significantly stronger in preschool children than in adults. Duration of manipulation had no effect on property-ownership transfer. Changes in the object's identity acted only as a secondary cue for children. We conclude that ownership is transferred after an investment of creative labor and that determining property ownership may be an intuitive process that emerges in early childhood.},

Participants read stories in which one character pursues an object (e.g., an animal being hunted, a gem jutting out of a high cliff), which a second character then captures. Judgments about which character owns the object depended on which character was plausibly necessary for capturing the object.

We developed SaferHome, an interactive digital-physical privacy framework, to provide smart home users with security and privacy assessments and a sense of device location. SaferHome includes a digital list view and physical and digital dashboards that map real floor plans. We evaluated SaferHome with eight households in the wild. We find that users adopted various strategies to integrate the dashboards into their understanding and interpretation of smart home privacy.

Although privacy in social media is well studied, the role of social (peer) privacy concerns is largely unknown and most privacy studies on mobile apps focus on initial adoption and ignore long-term behavioral outcomes. Drawing on the privacy calculus theory, this study examines the impact of both institutional and social privacy concerns on long-term user engagement with social media-enabled apps. Findings from the analysis of 354 survey responses reveal that both institutional and social privacy concerns decrease engagement. Regarding the antecedents, the perceived sensitivity of information increases institutional privacy concerns. However, social privacy concerns are influenced by the perception of risk and control. Moreover, while the impacts of social and enjoyment benefits are expectedly positive, the perception of efficiency benefits decreases engagement. These findings are further investigated and validated through a follow-up text analysis study, suggesting that users who enjoy the functionality of these apps are more likely to express social privacy concerns and minimize their engagement. This study contributes to the literature of privacy on mobile apps by unraveling the intricate dynamics of privacy concerns and benefits in the social mobile era.},

It investigates the implications of each component of privacy costs, privacy advantages, and trust on users' willingness to authorize their information, and explores how the five personality traits affect App users' perceived benefits, privacy concern, and trust. Simultaneously, the links between prior negative experience and privacy concern as well as the final authorizing willingness were uncovered. We employed a questionnaire to collect 455 users' data, and the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The findings demonstrate that App users' perceived benefits and trust have a positive impact on their privacy authorization intention, whereas privacy concerns negatively affect their disclosure willingness. Just as Extraversion and Agreeableness would make someone pay a heightened attention to the benefits, agreeable, neurotic, and conscientious users are more easily stimulated by privacy concern. Respectively, Agreeableness and Neuroticism affect users' trust positively and negatively. Additionally, prior negative experience will trigger an individual's privacy concern, which in turn hinders their willingness to authorize his/her information. All of the aforementioned can serve as a guide for App providers as they optimize the features of their products and services, implement the necessary privacy protections to alleviate users' privacy concern, and boost users' trust belief. More importantly, these results effectively demonstrate the significance of personal traits in the formation of users' privacy perceptions.},

  abstract = {A shared parameter model with logistic link is presented for longitudinal binary response data to accommodate informative drop-out. The model consists of observed longitudinal and missing response components that share random effects parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first presentation of such a model for longitudinal binary response data. Comparisons are made to an approximate conditional logit model in terms of a clinical trial dataset and simulations. The naive mixed effects logit model that does not account for informative drop-out is also compared. The simulation-based differences among the models with respect to coverage of confidence intervals, bias, and mean squared error (MSE) depend on at least two factors: whether an effect is a between- or within-subject effect and the amount of between-subject variation as exhibited by variance components of the random effects distributions. When the shared parameter model holds, the approximate conditional model provides confidence intervals with good coverage for within-cluster factors but not for between-cluster factors. The converse is true for the naive model. Under a different drop-out mechanism, when the probability of drop-out is dependent only on the current unobserved observation, all three models behave similarly by providing between-subject confidence intervals with good coverage and comparable MSE and bias but poor within-subject confidence intervals, MSE, and bias. The naive model does more poorly with respect to the within-subject effects than do the shared parameter and approximate conditional models. The data analysis, which entails a comparison of two pain relievers and a placebo with respect to pain relief, conforms to the simulation results based on the shared parameter model but not on the simulation based on the outcome-driven drop-out process. This comparison between the data analysis and simulation results may provide evidence that the shared parameter model holds for the pain data.},

Current permission managers, the core mechanism for privacy protection in smartphones, have shown to be ineffective by failing to account for privacy's contextual dependency and personal preferences within context. In this paper we focus on the relation between privacy decisions (e.g. grant or deny a permission request) and their surrounding context, through an analysis of a real world dataset obtained in campaigns with 93 users. We leverage such findings and the collected data to develop methods for automated, personalized and context-aware privacy protection, so as to predict users' preferences with respect to permission requests. Our analysis reveals that while contextual features have some relevance in privacy decisions, the increase in prediction performance of using such features is minimal, since two features alone are capable of capturing a relevant effect of context changes, namely the category of the requesting application and the requested permission. Our methods for prediction of privacy preferences achieved an F1 score of 0.88, while reducing the number of privacy violations by 28\% when compared to the standard Android permission manager.},

This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways: (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis: individual, group, organizational, and societal. Based upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside: the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships. As we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions. First, there are many theoretical developments in the body of normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy. Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test implied assertions from, these value-laden arguments could add great value. Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date. Future empirical studies --- both positivist and interpretive --- could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis. Third, positivist empirical studies will add the greatest value if they focus on antecedents to privacy concerns and on actual outcomes. In that light, we recommend that researchers be alert to an overarching macro model that we term APCO (Antecedents {$\rightarrow$} Privacy Concerns {$\rightarrow$} Outcomes).}

We present a causal-inference study to examine this phenomenon on the longitudinal Facebook use of 300+ participants who voluntarily shared their data spanning an average of 82 months before and 5 months after study enrollment. We measured deviation from participants' expected social media use through time series analyses. Individuals with high cognitive ability and low neuroticism decreased posting immediately after enrollment, and those with high openness increased posting. The sharing of self-focused content decreased, while diverse topics emerged. We situate the findings within theories of self-presentation and self-consciousness. We discuss the implications of correcting observer effect in social media data-driven measurements, and how this phenomenon shines light on the ethics of these measurements.},

These issues include missing contextual details, vague language, and overwhelming possible interpretations of described information transfers. We demonstrate this method in two different settings. First, we compare versions of Facebook's privacy policy from before and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Our analysis indicates that the updated policy still contains fundamental ambiguities that limit readers' comprehension of Facebook's data collection practices. Second, we successfully crowdsourced CI annotations of 48 excerpts of privacy policies from 17 companies with 141 crowdworkers. This indicates that regular users are able to reliably identify contextual information in privacy policy statements and that crowdsourcing can help scale our CI analysis method to a larger number of privacy policy statements.},

  abstract = {Modern enterprises rely on Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) systems to enforce privacy policies that prevent unintentional flow of sensitive information to unauthorized entities. However, these systems operate based on rule sets that are limited to syntactic analysis and therefore completely ignore the semantic relationships between participants involved in the information exchanges. For similar reasons, these systems cannot enforce complex privacy policies that require temporal reasoning about events that have previously occurred. To address these limitations, we advocate a new design methodology for DLP systems centered on the notion of Contextual Integrity (CI). We use the CI framework to abstract real-world communication exchanges into formally defined information flows where privacy policies describe sequences of admissible flows. CI allows us to decouple (1) the syntactic extraction of flows from information exchanges, and (2) the enforcement of privacy policies on these flows. We applied this approach to built VACCINE, a DLP auditing system for emails. VACCINE uses state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing to extract flows from email text. It also provides a declarative language for describing privacy policies. These policies are automatically compiled to operational rules that the system uses for detecting data leakages. We evaluated VACCINE on the Enron email corpus and show that it improves over the state of the art both in terms of the expressivity of the policies that DLP systems can enforce as well as its precision in detecting data leakages.},

Consequently, IoT vendors are legally obliged to provide privacy policies to declare the scope and purpose of the data collection. However, complex and lengthy privacy policies are unfriendly to users, and the lack of a machine-readable format makes it difficult to check policy compliance automatically. To solve these problems, we first put forward a purpose-aware rule to formalize the purpose-driven data collection or use statement. Then, a novel approach to identify the rule from natural language privacy policies is proposed. To address the issue of diversity of purpose expression, we present the concepts of explicit and implicit purpose, which enable using the syntactic and semantic analyses to extract purposes in different sentences. Finally, the domain adaption method is applied to the semantic role labeling (SRL) model to improve the efficiency of purpose extraction. The experiments that are conducted on the manually annotated dataset demonstrate that this approach can extract purpose-aware rules from the privacy policies with a high recall rate of 91\%. The implicit purpose extraction of the adapted model significantly improves the F1-score by 11\%.},

The results show that the most-used student-centered LA are perceived less appropriate than the less-used teacher-centered LA by both students and parents. The usage of personal characteristics in LA is perceived as least appropriate, in contrast to coarser class characteristics. Sharing insights of LA with institutions that are part of the traditional educational context, such as the school, is seen as the most appropriate, and more appropriate than sharing it with learning platforms or third parties (e.g., Big Tech). Overall, we found that parents evaluated the different elements of the dataflows embedded in LA as less appropriate than students. In the discussion, we argue that educational institutions should include the evaluation of both parents and students to further manage expectations and construct shared norms and practices when implementing LA in education.},

Applying the framework of contextual integrity (Nissenbaum, 2004, 2009), the research conducted discourse analysis on corporate communications to identify whether and how privacy conflicts arise in a data economy composed of multiple business entities that use LP member data. The major contributions of this study are a clarification of shortfalls in multi-organizational governance of health-related consumer data outside the HIPAA regulation in the United States, and a recognition that businesses may optimize this data without adequately informing consumers about the risks and providing meaningful redress mechanisms. The paper concludes by urging policy-makers to target networked business relationships and externalities that result from collective behavior of firms trading in consumer health data.},

  abstract = {Workplace monitoring practices have seen widespread growth since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As many employees shifted to remote work, companies began using a wide range of technologies to track employee communication and productivity, capturing video and screenshots, tracking websites visited and time spent on specific tasks, and even tracking attentiveness in Zoom meetings. While these practices may have been viewed as acceptable during the acute phase of the pandemic, concerns have mounted that these surveillance practices will continue in a postpandemic world because employers see benefits in capturing more data about workers. In this article, we present survey findings that explore workers' attitudes toward a wide range of workplace monitoring practices to understand where they draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable monitoring. This is especially important because of the potential for harm from widespread surveillance and an increasing reliance on predictive algorithms, which are more likely to negatively affect vulnerable populations. We also present findings related to gender differences in attitudes toward workplace surveillance; women found several types of data collection practices more concerning and more inappropriate than men.The future of work increasingly focuses on the collection and analysis of worker data to monitor communication, ensure productivity, reduce security threats, and assist in decision-making. The COVID-19 pandemic increased employer reliance on these technologies; however, the blurring of home and work boundaries meant these monitoring tools might also surveil private spaces. To explore workers' attitudes toward increased monitoring practices, we present findings from a factorial vignette survey of 645 U.S. adults who worked from home during the early months of the pandemic. Using the theory of privacy as contextual integrity to guide the survey design and analysis, we unpack the types of workplace surveillance practices that violate privacy norms and consider attitudinal differences between male and female workers. Our findings highlight that the acceptability of workplace surveillance practices is highly contextual, and that reductions in privacy and autonomy at work may further exacerbate power imbalances, especially for vulnerable employees.},

In addition, parents aimed to safeguard their child's privacy and prevent any misuse of their identity or any other forms of aggression. Furthermore, certain parents wish to grant their children the freedom to choose which media content about them is shared online at a later stage in life. As parents are aware of potential benefits of sharenting, they employ strategies to ensure their child's privacy, while still enjoying the benefits sharenting offers them. These strategies include photographing the child from a distance, the child looking away from the camera, focusing only on a body part, covering the face with an emoticon, blurring the face, or cutting recognizable parts from the photo.

  abstract = {Sharenting, a behaviour that parents share children's personal information online, has brought about multiple privacy concerns and risks. Parents are criticised for violating children's privacy and putting their identities at risk of being stolen. Existing sharenting studies tried to explain the sharenting behaviour based on the assumption that shared content is solely owned by children. This study, adopting a multiparty privacy perspective, proposed that sharenting content includes information owned solely by children and co-owned by parents and children, emphasizing the importance of recognizing information co-ownership by parents. By conducting 16 in-depth interviews, the current study investigated parents' perceptions of sharenting content and explored factors that may influence sharenting behaviours. Results indicated that parents have a misunderstanding of information ownership and are unaware of children's rights to co-owned information. Also, the sharenting behaviours are also influenced by audiences' comments, family members' privacy perceptions, cultural values, and exposure to negative news.},

Many mothers now share baby photos online, yet little is known about what kinds of baby photos they share and their motivations for doing so. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 22 new mothers, we find that they share cute, funny, milestone, and family and friend photos but refrain from sharing crying and naked photos. While some mothers harbor concerns about controlling information, oversharing, and digital footprints, the benefits of receiving validation outweighs their concerns. Sharing baby photos on Facebook helps new mothers enact and receive validation of "good mothering." However, mothers are charged with the responsibility of stewarding their children's privacy and identities online. We introduce the concept of privacy stewardship to describe the responsibility parents take on when deciding what is appropriate to share about their children online and ensuring that family and friends respect and maintain the integrity of those rules. As a result, mothers must exchange benefits of sharing baby photos with risks of creating digital footprints for their child.},

SPA capabilities are continually growing, with over a hundred thousand third-party skills in Amazon Alexa, covering several categories, from tasks within the home (e.g. managing smart devices) to tasks beyond the boundaries of the home (e.g. purchasing online, booking a ride). In the SPA ecosystem, information flows through several entities including SPA providers, third-party skills providers, providers of Smart Devices, other users and external parties. Prior studies have not explored privacy norms in the SPA ecosystem, i.e., the acceptability of these information flows. In this paper, we study privacy norms in SPAs based on Contextual Integrity through a large-scale study with 1,738 participants. We also study the influence that the Contextual Integrity parameters and personal factors have on the privacy norms. Further, we identify the similarities in terms of the Contextual Integrity parameters of the privacy norms studied to distill more general privacy norms, which could be useful, for instance, to establish suitable privacy defaults in SPA. We finally provide recommendations for SPA and third-party skill providers based on the privacy norms studied.},

We articulate that avoidance and adoption are two qualitatively different phenomena and contend that technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, but incomplete, understanding of users' IT threat avoidance behavior. Drawing from cybernetic theory and coping theory, TTAT delineates the avoidance behavior as a dynamic positive feedback loop in which users go through two cognitive processes, threat appraisal and coping appraisal, to decide how to cope with IT threats. In the threat appraisal, users will perceive an IT threat if they believe that they are susceptible to malicious IT and that the negative consequences are severe. The threat perception leads to coping appraisal, in which users assess the degree to which the IT threat can be avoided by taking safeguarding measures based on perceived effectiveness and costs of the safeguarding measure and self-efficacy of taking the safeguarding measure. TTAT posits that users are motivated to avoid malicious IT when they perceive a threat and believe that the threat is avoidable by taking safeguarding measures; if users believe that the threat cannot be fully avoided by taking safeguarding measures, they would engage in emotion-focused coping. Integrating process theory and variance theory, TTAT enhances our understanding of human behavior under IT threats and makes an important contribution to IT security research and practice.}

However, information flow in collaborative systems is complex, not always transparent to elderly users, and may raise privacy and security concerns. Because older adults' decisions about whether to engage in information exchange affect interpersonal communications and delivery of care, it is important to understand the factors and context that influence those decisions. Our work contributes empirical evidence and suggests a systematic approach. In this article, we present the results of semi-structured interviews with 46 older adults aged 65+ about their views on information collection, transmission, and sharing. We develop a detailed model of the contextual factors that combine in complex ways to affect older adults' decision making about information sharing. We discuss how our comprehensive model compares to existing frameworks for analyzing information-sharing expectations and preferences. Finally, we suggest directions for future research and describe the practical implications of our model for the design and evaluation of collaborative information-sharing systems, as well as for policy and consumer protection.},

This article explores how school publication of children's images on social media is contributing to children's datafication and how it is negatively impacting upon children's rights more generally. Identifying that schools across the UK, the US, Australia and Europe are now publishing children's images online, it situates the findings of an inquiry into UK practice within wider discussion of school practices worldwide. This article uses practice-based documentary analysis to evaluate guidance provided to schools by local education authorities (LEAs) across England, Scotland and Wales. It identifies that LEAs are failing to recognise children's Article 12 UNCRC right to be heard. LEAs frequently advise schools to seek consent from parents, denying children agency. Online publications which identify children potentially contravene Article 16 UNCRC's requirement not to subject a child to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy and may expose children to harms such as harassment and grooming. Nonetheless the template consent forms provided to parents provide minimal information about such risks. Concerns are raised that online publications are not always in children's best interests, thus contravening Article 3 UNCRC. With similar concerns having been raised in other jurisdictions, this article argues for a new child-rights focused approach. Drawing upon Dimopoulos' (2021) theory of children's decisional privacy and upon best practice from the UK, it suggests how schools across the globe can ensure children's rights and views inform school decisions to share children's images via social media.},

Analytical applications of CI in HCI primarily employ quantitative methods to identify appropriate information flows but rarely engage with the full CI framework to evaluate such flows. In this paper, we present a roadmap to guide HCI and social computing researchers on how to apply the full CI framework to qualitative projects. To help researchers envision what such an analysis can look like, each step includes an example analysis using interview data from projects on privacy and fitness tracking. We conclude by discussing how harnessing the full CI framework can address critiques of CI and identify opportunities for further theory development.},

Because privacy is grasped contextually (e.g., health, education, civic life, etc.), the values of these parameters range over contextually meaningful ontologies --- of information types (or topics) and actors (subjects, senders, and recipients), in contextually defined capacities. As an alternative to predominant approaches to privacy, which were ineffective against novel information practices enabled by IT, CI was able both to pinpoint sources of disruption and provide grounds for either accepting or rejecting them. Mounting challenges from a burgeoning array of networked, sensor-enabled devices (IoT) and data-ravenous machine learning systems, similar in form though magnified in scope, call for renewed attention to theory. This Article introduces the metaphor of a data (food) chain to capture the nature of these challenges. With motion up the chain, where data of higher order is inferred from lower-order data, the crucial question is whether privacy norms governing lower-order data are sufficient for the inferred higher-order data. While CI has a response to this question, a greater challenge comes from data primitives, such as digital impulses of mouse clicks, motion detectors, and bare GPS coordinates, because they appear to have no meaning. Absent a semantics, they escape CI's privacy norms entirely .},

Results revealed a significant impact of information type, sharing purpose, and sender on the perceived appropriateness of data sharing. Notably, data collected for research purposes or to develop new functionalities was deemed most appropriate, while data used for advertising was viewed unfavourably. Further, the user-controlled sharing received higher appropriateness ratings.

This study contributes such insights by using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework to discover how students (N = 456) rate the acceptability of 1064 proctoring information flows with varying information types, recipients, and transmission principles. We find that the acceptability varies considerably depending on the context. Besides exposing obvious privacy violations, we find that, under certain conditions, students consider it acceptable to share data with teachers - despite their lack of involvement in proctoring. Also, the acceptability of sharing highly sensitive information - which should under no circumstances be shared - sometimes increases. We discuss the implications of these and other findings and provide concrete recommendations for educational institutions using online proctoring.},

  abstract = {A growing body of theory has focused on privacy as being contextually defined, where individuals have highly particularized judgments about the appropriateness of what, why, how, and to whom information flows within a specific context. Such a social contract understanding of privacy could produce more practical guidance for organizations and managers who have employees, users, and future customers all with possibly different conceptions of privacy across contexts. However, this theoretical suggestion, while intuitively appealing, has not been empirically examined. This study validates a social contract approach to privacy by examining whether and how privacy norms vary across communities and contractors. The findings from this theoretical examination support the use of contractual business ethics to understand privacy in research and in practice. As predicted, insiders to a community had significantly different understandings of privacy norms as compared to outsiders. In addition, all respondents held different privacy norms across hypothetical contexts, thereby suggesting privacy norms are contextually understood within a particular community of individuals. The findings support two conclusions. First, individuals hold different privacy norms without necessarily having diminished expectations of privacy. Individuals differed on the factors they considered important in calculating privacy expectations, yet all groups had robust privacy expectations across contexts. Second, outsiders have difficulty in understanding the privacy norms of a particular community. For managers and scholars, this renders privacy expectations more difficult to identify at a distance or in deductive research. The findings speak directly to the needs of organizations to manage a diverse set of privacy issues across stakeholder groups.},

  abstract = {Factorial surveys constitute a specific technique for introducing experimental designs in sample surveys. Respondents are presented with descriptions (vignettes) of a constructed world in which important factors are built in experimentally. Using balanced designs well known from the multivariate experimental tradition, it is possible to build in a relatively large number of factors and levels. Within this context, the normal hypothesis is that responses are consistent on the individual level, but not totally idiosyncratic. In the analysis, it is important to determine the influence of both the vignette and the respondent variables. Analysis models for this type of data should reflect the fact that factorial surveys produce data pertaining to two distinct levels: the individual level and the vignette level. Such models are available and are generally known as multilevel analysis models. This article discusses the properties of factorial survey designs and some analysis models that address the multilevel aspects of the data. An example is presented using data on judgments on the fairness of incomes.},

One variant of this is `causal moderation', which implies that intervention upon a third (moderator) variable would alter the treatment effect. This study considers the conditions under which causal moderation can be identified and presents a generalized framework for estimating causal moderation effects given randomized treatments and non-randomized moderators. As part of the estimation process, it allows researchers to implement their preferred method of covariate adjustment, including parametric and non-parametric methods, or alternative identification strategies of their choosing. In addition, it provides a set-up whereby sensitivity analysis designed for the average treatment effect context can be extended to the moderation context. To illustrate the methods, the study presents two applications: one dealing with the effect of using the term `welfare' to describe public assistance in the United States, and one dealing with the effect of asylum seekers' religion on European attitudes towards asylum seekers.},

  abstract = {Modern advances in AI have increased employer interest in tracking workers' biometric signals --- e.g., their brainwaves and facial expressions --- to evaluate and make predictions about their performance and productivity. These technologies afford managers information about internal emotional and physiological states that were previously accessible only to individual workers, raising new concerns around worker privacy and autonomy. Yet, the research literature on the impact of AI-powered biometric work monitoring (AI-BWM) technologies on workers remains fragmented across disciplines and industry sectors, limiting our understanding of its impacts on workers at large. In this paper, we sytematically review 129 papers, spanning varied disciplines and industry sectors, that discuss and analyze the impact of AI-powered biometric monitoring technologies in occupational settings. We situate this literature across a process model that spans the development, deployment, and usage phases of these technologies. We further draw on Shelby et al.'s Taxonomy of Socio-technical Harms in AI systems to systematize the harms experienced by workers across the three phases of our process model. We find that the development, deployment, and sustained use of AI-powered biometric work monitoring technologies put workers at risk of a number of the socio-technical harms specified by Shelby et al.: e.g., by forcing workers to exert additional emotional labor to avoid flagging unreliable affect monitoring systems, or through the use of these data to make inferences about productivity. Our research contributes to the field of critical AI studies by highlighting the potential for a cascade of harms to occur when the impact of these technologies on workers is not considered at all phases of our process model.},

It also supports the prospect of incorporating controls to help minimize harms that emerge from the interplay of technologies and social and cultural dynamics. A growing body of scholarship has identified a wide range of harms across different algorithmic technologies. However, computing research and practitioners lack a high level and synthesized overview of harms from algorithmic systems. Based on a scoping review of computing research (n=172), we present an applied taxonomy of sociotechnical harms to support a more systematic surfacing of potential harms in algorithmic systems. The final taxonomy builds on and refers to existing taxonomies, classifications, and terminologies. Five major themes related to sociotechnical harms --- representational, allocative, quality-of-service, interpersonal harms, and social system/societal harms --- and sub-themes are presented along with a description of these categories. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities for future research.},

Through iterative refinement with topic experts and crowdsourced annotation testing, we propose a taxonomy that can serve as a powerful tool for civil society organisations, educators, policymakers, product teams and the general public.

  abstract = {Understanding how exposure to news on social media impacts public discourse and exacerbates political polarization is a significant endeavor in both computer and social sciences. Unfortunately, progress in this area is hampered by limited access to data due to the closed nature of social media platforms. Consequently, prior studies have been constrained to considering only fragments of users' news exposure and reactions. To overcome this obstacle, we present an innovative measurement approach centered on donating personal data for scientific purposes, facilitated through a privacy-preserving tool that captures users' interactions with news on Facebook. This approach offers a nuanced perspective on users' news exposure and consumption, encompassing different types of news exposure: selective, incidental, algorithmic, and targeted, driven by the diverse underlying mechanisms governing news appearance on users' feeds. Our analysis of data from 472 participants based in the U.S. reveals several interesting findings. For instance, users are more prone to encountering misinformation because of their active selection of low-quality news sources rather than being exposed solely due to friends or platform algorithms. Furthermore, our study uncovers that users are open to engaging with news sources with opposite political ideology as long as these interactions are not visible to their immediate social circles. Overall, our study showcases the viability of data donation as a means to provide clarity to longstanding questions in this field, offering new perspectives on the intricate dynamics of social media news consumption and its effects.},

We followed 1491 adult smokers over 24 months and related quitting status at follow-up to exposure to antismoking ads in the 2 years prior to the baseline assessment. Results. On average, smokers were exposed to more than 200 antismoking ads during the 2-year period, as estimated by televised gross ratings points (GRPs). The odds of having quit at follow-up increased by 11\% with each 10 additional potential ad exposures (per 1000 points, odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00, 1.23; P {$<$} .05). Greater exposure to ads that contained highly emotional elements or personal stories drove this effect (OR = 1.14; 95\% CI 1.02, 1.29; P {$<$} .05), which was greater among respondents with low and mid-socioeconomic status than among high--socioeconomic status groups. Conclusions. Emotionally evocative ads and ads that contain personalized stories about the effects of smoking and quitting hold promise for efforts to promote smoking cessation and reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking.},

They credit the movement for: empowering survivors to disclose their experience possibly due to reduced stigma surrounding sexual victimization given the number of disclosures, providing support through social media from other survivors, and increasing societal awareness of the prevalence of sexual victimization. Those interviewed fault the movement for: giving the false perception that since so many survivors are stepping forward then reports must be fabricated, pressuring victims to support the movement through disclose and criticizing those who do not disclose, and hindering survivors' ability to escape media and social media coverage of sexual victimization. Advocates perceived \#MeToo to be more of a ``movement'' rather than a ``moment.'' However, to sustain its progress advocates suggested that action must be taken to create change for survivors and to reduce the occurrence of sexual victimization through policy/legal change and perpetrator accountability.},

Individuals make choices in which they surrender a certain degree of privacy in exchange for outcomes that are perceived to be worth the risk of information disclosure. This research attempts to better understand the delicate balance between privacy risk beliefs and confidence and enticement beliefs that influence the intention to provide personal information necessary to conduct transactions on the Internet. A theoretical model that incorporated contrary factors representing elements of a privacy calculus was tested using data gathered from 369 respondents. Structural equations modeling (SEM) using LISREL validated the instrument and the proposed model. The results suggest that although Internet privacy concerns inhibit e-commerce transactions, the cumulative influence of Internet trust and personal Internet interest are important factors that can outweigh privacy risk perceptions in the decision to disclose personal information when an individual uses the Internet. These findings provide empirical support for an extended privacy calculus model.},

It also considers CFIP's relationship to privacy-protecting behaviours and incorporates trust and risk into the model. These relationships are tested in a specific, Facebook-related context. Results strongly support the overall model. PA and gender are important explanators for CFIP, which in turn explains privacy-protecting behaviours.

Regarding the prevalence of deepfake pornography victimization and perpetration, 2.2\% of all respondents indicated personal victimization, and 1.8\% all of respondents indicated perpetration behaviors. Respondents from countries with specific legislation still reported perpetration and victimization experiences, suggesting NSII laws are inadequate to deter perpetration.

Across three studies, we found that agreeableness was the dimension of personality most closely associated with emotional reactions to victims in need of help, and subsequent decisions to help those individuals.

  abstract = {E-commerce companies are beginning to use data analytics to individually address their customers, as such firms are strongly dependent on customers' willingness to disclose (WTD) personal information. Conceptually known as privacy calculus, a cognitive comparison of the predicted benefits and risks of such a disclosure results in subjective expected utility (SEU). As this construct has not been elucidated in the context of situational factors, namely personalization and information sensitivity, this research utilizes a quantitative experimental study design to analyze these factors and evaluate the impact of SEU on customers' WTD. Based on an online survey, the study reveals a positive but decreasing effect of personalization on SEU, while identifying information sensitivity as a negative influential factor. In general, the results emphasize the importance of a fair and transparent exchange relationship to foster a data disclosure setting without acute data privacy concerns.},

  abstract = {On social media, due to complex interactions between users' attention and recommendation algorithms, the visibility of users' posts can be unpredictable and vary wildly, sometimes creating unexpected viral events for `ordinary' users. How do such events affect users' subsequent behaviors and long-term visibility on the platform? We investigate these questions following a matching-based framework using a dataset comprised of tweeting activities and follower graph changes of 17,157 scientists on Twitter.  We identified scientists who experienced `unusual' virality for the first time in their profile lifespan (`viral' group) and quantified how viral events influence tweeting behaviors and popularity (as measured through follower statistics). After virality, the viral group increased tweeting frequency, their tweets became more objective and focused on fewer topics, and expressed more positive sentiment relative to their pre-virality tweets. Also, their post-virality tweets were more aligned with their professional expertise and similar to the viral tweet compared to past tweets. Finally, the viral group gained more followers in both the short and long terms compared to a control group.},

  abstract = {Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held  collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder  wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release  a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are  the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain  practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal  protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies  for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the  information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from  at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release.  This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on  releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies  are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because  it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly,  {$\mu$}-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy  protection.},

  abstract = {Today's globally networked society places great demands on the dissemination and sharing of information. While in the past released information was mostly in tabular and statistical form, many situations call for the release of specific data (microdata). In order to protect the anonymity of the entities (called respondents) to which information refers, data holders often remove or encrypt explicit identifiers such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. Deidentifying data, however, provides no guarantee of anonymity. Released information often contains other data, such as race, birth date, sex, and ZIP code, that can be linked to publicly available information to reidentify respondents and inferring information that was not intended for disclosure. In this paper we address the problem of releasing microdata while safeguarding the anonymity of respondents to which the data refer. The approach is based on the definition of k-anonymity. A table provides k-anonymity if attempts to link explicitly identifying information to its content map the information to at least k entities. We illustrate how k-anonymity can be provided without compromising the integrity (or truthfulness) of the information released by using generalization and suppression techniques. We introduce the concept of minimal generalization that captures the property of the release process not distorting the data more than needed to achieve k-anonymity, and present an algorithm for the computation of such a generalization. We also discuss possible preference policies to choose among different minimal generalizations.},
